0," On a Train trip north toward Aberdeen, the Scottish poet and naturalist Kathleen Jamie witnessed an arresting optical illusion. As the rail car passed between the North Sea and winter woodlands, a reflection caused the nautical scene to mingle with the forest view from Ms. Jamie’s window. “If I narrowed my eyes,” she tells readers of “Surfacing,” her new collection of essays, “I could see both sea and trees at once. And now there was a ship! A ghostly tanker was sailing over the pine trees.” It was a lovely vision that another traveler, in the thrall of handheld technology, completely missed. “A woman nearby was on her mobile,” Ms. Jamie laments, “loud and getting louder. . . . Her fellow passengers were glancing at each other, rolling their eyes.” By Kathleen Jamie
Penguin, 247 pages, $17 This anecdote, in an essay called “A Reflection,” serves as a kind of keynote for “Surfacing,” underscoring Ms. Jamie’s two principal themes: the degree to which the natural world is full of vivid juxtapositions—and our tendency to overlook them because we’re distracted by the ephemera of everyday life. Ms. Jamie is particularly concerned in these essays with the interplay between the deep past and the present. Like the celebrated nature writer Loren Eiseley, who could report on an ancient bison bone and his pet dog in the same breath, bringing the remote record of earlier lives into the warm immediacy of his household, Ms. Jamie connects the relics of distant ages with the daily routines in front of her. At an archaeological dig in coastal Alaska, where Ms. Jamie is helping to excavate a buried village settled by natives some five centuries earlier, she thinks she smells “mince and tatties,” a hearty Scottish dish of meat and potatoes. Is she having some sort of olfactory hallucination evoked by her childhood? The scent, Ms. Jamie discovers, is from a part of the freshly unearthed site where seals and walruses were once skinned. “The air is so clean and sharp,” she writes, “you can smell seal-meat from five hundred years ago.” The windfall of Alaskan artifacts that Ms. Jamie helps document has revealed itself because the permafrost is melting. “For generations,” she notes, “the frozen earth had held these objects fast, like charms in a Christmas cake, but now the objects were falling to the seashore to be washed away for good.” Other references to climate change in “Surfacing” sound its softly elegiac tone. “The world warms,” Ms. Jamie writes in “The Reindeer Cave,” the book’s opening essay. “Last winter was the wettest; no snow or ice to speak of, a flash of blue sky was rare as a comet, the nights were starless and lachrymose. The TV news showed floods and sandbags, householders weeping as they cleared the sodden mess.” The essay takes its name from one of the so-called Bone Caves in Scotland, where skeletal remains from various beasts have been found, some of them thousands of years old. As Ms. Jamie stands at a cave mouth and ponders the Ice Age, children arrive to explore, too, snatching her—or at least part of her—back to the present. She seems to be straddling millennia for a minute, crossing a tightrope that any practiced naturalist learns to walk. Listening to an Alaskan tribal member tell of the uncanny homing instinct of sled dogs, Ms. Jamie confesses that “I was unsure whether the event [he recounted] happened to him, or his grandfather, or someone else entirely. I don’t know whether it matters.” For a student of nature, she hints, time becomes a casual continuum, much like the fabled temporal stream in which Henry David Thoreau went a-fishing. Ms. Jamie appears more gregarious than Thoreau and most other nature writers. While the genre is deeply populated by solitaries, her essays brim with people. “Surfacing” also chronicles her travels in Tibet, but some of the book’s most memorable essays grow from her native soil in Scotland, including “Elders,” an affectionate portrait of her aged father, who passes away in a “chair turned toward the window.” Without quite saying so, Ms. Jamie suggests that her father died as any enlightened soul should live—alert to the view, curious about what will happen next. It’s a discipline she’s still practicing, she admits—an aspiration that, like any ideal, is never quite perfected. “We chose to sit quietly,” she writes of a summer afternoon on the Alaskan tundra, “and in a short space of time, maybe twenty minutes of looking out over the landscape, I realised my eyes were adjusting, my vision sharpening. . . . After an hour, my senses were still clarifying. Perhaps it would never stop.” —Mr. Heitman, a columnist for the Advocate newspaper in Louisiana, is the author of “A Summer of Birds: John James Audubon at Oakley House.” ",https://www.wsj.com/articles/surfacing-review-the-past-is-ever-present-11569017682,Medium,-1,Yes,0
1,"As the grotesquerie masquerading as a presidential campaign slouches toward its end, a final spectacle — a “debate” — is slated for Wednesday. It is hard to imagine a worse circumstance. Trump, more at ease with insults than ideas, is in the midst of a mortifying public self-immolation. The Clinton campaign has heated itself into a faux Cold War lather over WikiLeaks’ release of hacked campaign emails. And as a final measure, the “moderator,” Chris Wallace, is supplied by Fox News, a virtual guarantee that the scandalous will supplant the substantial.
It is probably a fool’s errand to suggest that Wallace explore real issues rather than raking the muck over again. But opinions have already hardened on everything from Clinton’s “damned emails” to Trump’s predation. Rather than ask Trump about his libido or Clinton about the “deplorables,” why not pose fundamental questions that have received far too little attention in this campaign?
Wallace has already released a list of topics for the debate: debt and entitlements, immigration, economy, Supreme Court, “foreign hot spots” and fitness to be president. Of course, previous debate moderators also released seemingly substantive lists of topics, to no avail. That said, though we’ve already heard a lot about immigration (“Build the wall”), the Supreme Court and fitness for the presidency, some of these could be used to frame real concerns.

For example, ""foreign hot spots"" might start with the hottest spot of all: the Earth. Bizarrely, we are headed into the last debate without a single question on climate change, and there were no questions on the topic in the 2012 debates either. Last year was the hottest year on record; this year is worse. The Pentagon considers climate change a clear and present danger that will destabilize far more countries than al-Qaeda and its offshoots will. The two candidates have totally contrasting positions that voters should hear. The Democratic platform calls for a ""World War II style mobilization"" against climate change — a phrase often used by Clinton's primary opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.). Is Clinton ready to lead that charge, and if so, what will it entail? Trump says climate change is a hoax and calls for unleashing oil and coal production. What would he do about global warming: ignore it, deny it or choose to act?
On the economy, Wallace could probe the issue where the two candidates stand united against the bipartisan elite consensus of the past decades. Both oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership that President Obama and Republican leaders in Congress support. Both say it is a bad deal. Both say our trade policies haven’t worked for working people. So ask, “Would you urge the Congress to vote down the TPP? How would you change trade strategies going forward?”
Finally, it would be a true disservice to the country if the debate doesn’t center on the growing fears that the United States is careening into a reckless face-off with Russia and lurching deeper into war in the Middle East.

So ask Clinton: The Obama administration has broken off discussions with Russia about Syria, saying there is ""nothing more for the United States and Russia to talk about."" Secretary of State John F. Kerry has called for a war-crimes investigation of Russia and Syria. Vice President Biden boasts that the United States will send a message ""at the time of our choosing"" to Vladi­mir Putin to retaliate for the alleged Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee and your campaign emails. The Russian Ministry of Defense warned Washington against carrying out airstrikes aimed at Syrian forces. Yet you have called for establishing a ""no-fly zone"" and enforcing ""safe zones"" in Syria, which you admit will entail severe Syrian civilian casualties and could risk war with Russia. Are you willing to take that risk? Do you think we should ramp up or cool down tensions with Russia? Do you agree that there is nothing to talk about, or should we listen to allies who are pleading with us to talk with the Russians?
Ask Trump: In the last debate, you criticized the Obama administration for not being serious about the Islamic State. You argued that the United States should cooperate with Russia, Iran and the Syrian government to take out the Islamic State. How is that a more effective approach to fighting the terrorist group?
We need a debate worthy of the challenges we face as a nation. Trump prefers tweeting on the weight of Miss Universe or the guilt or innocence of the Central Park Five. The Clinton campaign wants to turn the hacking of documents that ended up in the hands of WikiLeaks into the next Watergate.

But the next president will have to deal with real crises, not campaign detritus. After 14 years of war, the United States seems to be getting drawn in even deeper into endless conflicts. It may be impossible to have a policy discussion amid all the spitballs, but surely it is worth a try.

2," President-elect Joe Biden’s pick for secretary of state is set to face intensive questioning from GOP senators concerned that a Biden administration will return to policies they opposed during the Obama administration. Antony Blinken, a longtime Biden aide and former deputy secretary of state, is likely to have a confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in January, during the waning days of the Trump administration, congressional staffers and analysts said. Barring unexpected disclosures or political maneuvers, Mr. Blinken, a former staff chief for the Senate committee, is expected to be confirmed without difficulty, even as the partisan composition of the Senate depends on the outcome of two races in Georgia on Jan. 5. Still, Republican senators on the committee are set to question Mr. Blinken on priorities they have helped advance during the Trump administration. Some Republicans on the panel who are likely to ask tough questions, including Sens. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Ted Cruz (R., Texas), have had presidential ambitions in recent years. Foreign-policy experts say Mr. Blinken is unlikely to reveal many details of the early efforts to formulate the detailed policies of the new administration. How do you think Antony Blinken will approach the role of secretary of state? Join the conversation below. Mr. Biden has said his administration’s policies will be different from previous Democratic administrations because Washington now faces a “totally different world,” shaped in part by the Trump administration. Some GOP lawmakers will try to probe whether Mr. Blinken sticks to more- centrist foreign-policy views or whether the administration will entertain some of the more-progressive views of those in the party who want to avoid foreign interventions and give priority to climate change over other issues, diplomatic analysts said. “On the Democratic side, they’re kind of all over the place, and it’s uncertain how they’re going to accommodate all those views,” said Jim Carafano, director of the national-security and foreign-policy studies institute at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. Below are foreign-policy issues of longstanding contention that Mr. Blinken is likely to face: Biden team members said they would reverse Trump administration policy and seek to return to the 2015 nuclear agreement negotiated under the Obama administration—provided that Iran return to compliance with its enrichment limits. They would then try to negotiate lengthier and more-stringent constraints. Lawmakers opposed to such a move are likely to question Mr. Blinken on what steps the new administration would take to establish a dialogue with Iran. “They’ve got this goal of getting back in the agreement, but it’s not clear what the path is for doing so,” said Gary Schmitt of the American Enterprise Institute. President Trump launched a trade war with Beijing, then sought to cooperate on a trade deal before finally presiding over a sharp deterioration in relations with China. Mr. Biden has said he would enlist U.S. allies in confronting Beijing, but aides have signaled they would try to work with China in areas where it makes sense, similar to what the Obama administration did. Lawmakers in both parties, who almost universally back a tough approach, want to know more, including how far officials would go in working with Beijing. “Blinken probably tends towards those who probably think there’s a national-security problem with China that engagement simply isn’t going to solve,” Mr. Schmitt said. Mr. Trump met three times with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. While North Korea has refrained from conducting nuclear tests and long-range-missile flights, negotiations between the two sides didn’t produce an agreement. The Biden administration has said that it will work more closely with China and allies to try to make diplomatic headway. In a 2018 op-ed, Mr. Blinken suggested a step-by-step approach. A first step would be an interim agreement requiring North Korea to freeze production of fissile material and destroy some weapons. The U.S., in return, would provide limited economic relief. Complete denuclearization and a peace treaty would be the eventual goal. President Trump has ordered the reduction of U.S. troops in Afghanistan to 2,500 and appointed an envoy who negotiated a shaky peace with the Taliban. The U.S. military has warned that rising violence is endangering the diplomatic efforts. Mr. Blinken will likely be asked how the Biden administration plans to shore up the diplomatic process. On Iraq, Mr. Blinken faced harsh congressional questioning in 2014 over the Obama administration’s 2011 U.S. troop withdrawal, which was followed by the rise of Islamic State. Following that experience, Mr. Biden has said he would retain a small U.S. counterterrorism force in the region instead of withdrawing completely. Republicans, who have resisted Mr. Trump’s efforts to reduce the number of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan are likely to press Mr. Blinken for details. The Trump administration’s tough approach to Iran and strong backing for Israeli policies resulted in deals for Arab countries to normalize their relations with Israel. The Biden team supports those normalization efforts but also plans to try to rebuild ties with the Palestinians, advisers have said. Mr. Blinken is likely to face questions about Mr. Biden’s approach toward Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, which were criticized by the Obama administration but embraced by the Trump administration. Mr. Blinken and other Biden officials face a series of quick decisions on Russia as the New START arms-control treaty is scheduled to expire in early February. Mr. Biden and Moscow both want to renew the arms deal and use it as foundation for further arms-control arrangements. While arms control is one area of potential cooperation, Mr. Biden is likely to take a tougher tone on Russia than Mr. Trump, who valued his calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and blamed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and European allies for not living up to military-spending commitments. Mr. Blinken might get questions about how to respond to the hacking of U.S. government computers, which has been linked to Russia’s intelligence services. Mr. Blinken says the Biden administration will immediately move to rejoin the Paris climate accord, which was negotiated under then-Secretary of State John Kerry in 2015 but dropped by Mr. Trump. Senators are likely to ask to what degree a Biden administration would give priority to climate-change cooperation in international negotiations, or what domestic steps the U.S. will take to meet its own climate goals. They also might ask about Mr. Kerry’s role as Mr. Biden’s special presidential climate envoy. Write to William Mauldin at william.mauldin@wsj.com and Michael R.

Polar bears have shown remarkable resilience in the face of a warming climate. Researchers have seen them grow more opportunistic in their hunting and eating habits, suggesting that the species may adapt to the limited availability of traditional prey by finding other sources of food. But sometimes that adaptability has troubling consequences.
A newly released video from National Geographic captures rarely seen polar bear cannibalism. The victim — a young cub — couldn't outrun the adult male that made a meal of it as its mother watched. (Warning: The video is graphic.)
This behavior has been studied (and even captured on video) before, and it probably happens more often than we'd like to think: Whenever seals become scarce or hard to hunt, as they do when ice disappears, male polar bears become desperate.
Advertisement
""This type of intraspecific predation has always occurred to some extent,"" Jenny Ross, who co-authored a study on a similar event she witnessed, told the BBC in 2011.  ""However, there are increasing numbers of observations of it occurring, particularly on land where polar bears are trapped ashore, completely food-deprived for extended periods of time due to the loss of sea ice as a result of climate change.""
Thanks, global warming: Now polar bears are devouring dolphins
Researchers have witnessed several less troubling signs of this desperation in recent years, including record-breaking dives in search of scant food and the hunting of species of dolphin that polar bears had previously ignored. But as impressive as it is that the 26,000 or so polar bears left on the planet are being resourceful, it's unlikely that this cobbling together of food sources will support the population.
“In the long term, the populations of these species of food for the polar bears are going to decline,” Peter Ewins, leader of Arctic conservation for the World Wide Fund for Nature, told National Geographic in September. “So it’s not going to be a persisting source of high fat for the polar bears.”
Advertisement
For now, there's no way of knowing for sure whether cannibalism is growing more common. We've certainly become more aware of it in recent years, but that might just be because of an increase in eco-tourism and research in the Arctic. But even if occasional cannibalism is a normal practice when food is scarce, the lean times caused by global warming are hardly going to help.

4," President Trump said he hoped to clinch a trade agreement with Europe before the 2020 U.S. presidential election, promised overhauls of the World Trade Organization and signaled concern over calling witnesses at the Senate impeachment trial. In a wide-ranging news conference at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday shortly before returning to the U.S., Mr. Trump sought to focus on the economy, ticking off a list of statistics that he said showed “America’s unprecedented economic successes.”            “We are the talk of the town, so to speak,” the president said of his reception at the annual gathering of business executives and world leaders. How would you assess President Trump’s time at the World Economic Forum? Join the conversation below. But the subject soon turned to the impeachment trial, which is dominating the attention of Washington and many in Mr. Trump’s inner circle. NEWSLETTER SIGN-UP WSJ Politics & Policy Scoops, analysis and insights driving Washington from the WSJ's D.C. bureau. As House Democrats prepared to make their case in the Senate for the president’s removal, Mr. Trump said that calling witnesses in the trial would be “up to the Senate” and said he could “live either way.” He also said that he had national-security concerns about allowing former national security adviser John Bolton and others to testify. “I would rather go the long way, I would rather interview Bolton, I would rather interview a lot of people. The problem with John is that it’s a national security problem,” Mr. Trump said. “He knows some of my thoughts, he knows what I think about leaders.” Mr. Bolton, whom Mr. Trump fired in September after nearly a year and a half on the job, has said he would testify if subpoenaed. Mr. Trump also provided reasons for blocking possible testimony from acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former energy secretary Rick Perry. He said Mr. Mulvaney had “expressed himself very well” in a news interview and there wasn’t “much he can add.” And he cited national-security concerns about any testimony from Mr. Pompeo or Mr. Perry. Following a lengthy day of deliberation over trial rules, the president praised his legal team, saying of White House counsel Pat Cipollone: “I was very impressed with Pat, he had great emotion yesterday. Pat’s a brilliant guy, but I’ve never seen that emotion.” Mr. Trump criticized Rep. Jerrold Nadler, (D., N.Y.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and one of the impeachment managers, calling him a “sleazebag.” And he insisted he didn’t know Lev Parnas, an associate of Rudy Giuliani. Mr. Parnas has in recent days sought to tie the president to efforts he made with Mr. Giuliani in Ukraine to launch investigations that could benefit the president politically. “I don’t know him other than he’s sort of like a groupie, he shows up at fundraisers,” said Mr. Trump, who went on to praise Mr. Giuliani. Looking ahead, Mr. Trump said he didn’t see a reason to delay his Feb. 4 State of the Union address. Earlier in the news conference, Mr. Trump said he met with WTO Director-General Roberto Azevêdo to discuss the president’s longstanding frustrations with the organization. “Roberto and I have a tremendous relationship, and we’re going to do something that I think will be very dramatic,” he said without offering details. The president said Mr. Azevêdo was planning a trip to Washington in the coming weeks to discuss overhauling the WTO. Joining Mr. Trump at the news conference, Mr. Azevêdo agreed with the president. “It has to be updated; it has to be changed; it has to be reformed,” Mr. Azevêdo said. Advertisement - Scroll to Continue The president said he hoped that the U.S. would reach a new trade agreement with Europe, saying he had a deadline in his head for making a deal, but declined to publicly reveal it. “I have a date in my mind and it’s a fairly quick date,” he said. Mr. Trump had earlier expressed confidence that the U.S. would reach a new trade agreement with Europe, arguing that leaders in the region have “no choice” but to make a deal amid the threat of auto tariffs.  In an interview with CNBC that aired Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he had a “great talk” with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on Tuesday. “I said, look, if we don’t get something, I’m going to have to take action, and the action will be very high tariffs on their cars and other things that come into our country,” he recalled telling Ms. von der Leyen during the interview. But he added that investors shouldn’t panic at the prospect of tariffs on European cars. “They’re going to make a deal, because they have to. They have to. They have no choice,” he said. Mr. Trump renewed his threat to hit Europe with auto tariffs in an interview Tuesday with The Wall Street Journal. The president also said the 11 Americans being screened for traumatic brain injuries after the Iranian missile attack on two bases in Iraq last week weren’t seriously hurt. “I heard that they had headaches and a couple of other things,” he said. “But I can say, and I can report, it is not very serious.” Wednesday’s news conference wrapped up Mr. Trump’s two-day appearance at the summit, where he gave a speech touting the U.S. economy and had private meetings with world leaders and CEOs. Mr. Trump shared the limelight at the summit with Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist who has excoriated world leaders for not doing more to address climate change. “Our house is still on fire,” she told the audience during her remarks. “Your inaction is fueling the flames by the hour.” Mr. Trump, in his speech shortly before Ms. Thunberg, called on attendees to “reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse.” He echoed that sentiment during his news conference, encouraging Ms. Thunberg, who he noted beat him out as Time magazine’s person of the year, to focus on pollution from other countries, not the U.S. “I think that some people, they’ve put it at a level that’s unrealistic, to the point that you can’t live your life,” he said of climate activists. The president met with several dozen business executives Wednesday morning for a closed-door breakfast. Mr. Trump arrived late to the event. During his remarks to the executives, he touted the economy, trumpeting low unemployment and wage gains. He pointed to tax cuts, deregulation and the trade deal as things he had delivered to the corporate sector, according to a person familiar with the meeting. The president also told the executives that his polling numbers looked better than ever. As he heads back to Washington, Mr. Trump mused about the possibility of appearing at his own impeachment trial. “I’d love to go, wouldn’t that be great,” he said. “I’d sort of love to sit in the front row and stare at their corrupt faces.” But he indicated his legal team may have other ideas, acknowledging: “I think they might have a problem.” Charles Forelle contributed to this article.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) may emerge this week at the top of the pack of Democratic challengers vying to unseat President Trump. Polls showed the left-leaning senator leading a crowded field ahead of Monday night’s Iowa caucuses. He is also among the front-runners in the subsequent primaries in New Hampshire and Nevada, buoyed by a base energized by his long-standing calls for sweeping reform.

Sanders and some of his Democratic competitors are clear about what they want to change in the United States. They call for the building of a robust social democratic state, including programs such as universal healthcare, funded in large part by new taxation on the ultrarich and Wall Street. In an age defined by widening social inequity and fatigue with the status quo, a younger generation has helped catapult his brand of “democratic socialism” into the mainstream.
The financial sector grew fivefold as a share of the economy since the 1970s.

The result? More greed, corruption, criminality, bloated CEO pay, financial crashes and taxpayer bailouts.

Maybe Wall Street should face some downsizing so that the working class can finally thrive.
— Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) February 2, 2020
Sanders is particularly fond of the “Nordic model” — the social plans that exist in countries such as Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland, which deploy higher taxation to provide quality public services and keep inequality at rates lower than the United States. It’s an analogy Sanders often invokes, not least to defuse the polemics from opponents to the right that he’s akin to a Latin American demagogue-in-waiting.

Across the Atlantic, at least one leading proponent of the Nordic model welcomed its embrace by U.S. politicians. “We feel that the Nordic Model is a success story,” said Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin in an interview with The Washington Post last month on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
Marin said she recognizes that “every country’s situation is different, every country’s political atmosphere is different,” but that Finland’s system could set an example for the United States nonetheless.
“I feel that the American Dream can be achieved best in the Nordic countries, where every child no matter their background or the background of their families can become anything, because we have a very good education system,” she said. “We have a good health-care and social welfare system that allows anybody to become anything. This is probably one of the reasons why Finland gets ranked the happiest country in the world.”
Advertisement
That’s precisely the argument those on the American left are trying to make. Sanders has long hailed Finland’s social policies. In 2008, before a standing-room-only crowd in the city hall of Burlington, Vt., Sanders welcomed the Finnish ambassador to his state and urged his compatriots to study “one of the best economic and social models in the world.”
“In Finland, a high-quality national health-care program exists which provides almost-free health care for all — and ends up costing about half as much per capita as our system,” Sanders said at the time. “In Finland, when students become doctors and nurses, they leave school debt-free — because there are no costs in going to school. Is there something we can learn from that model?”
In that same conversation, Sanders brushed aside the suggestion that Finland’s small population — barely 1/60th of that of the United States — should complicate the picture. “As we acknowledge the difference, we should also acknowledge that we are all human beings with very much the same DNA, the same kind of intelligence and the same human needs,” he said.

Sanders’s ascent in the past five years has spurred considerable debate over what lessons should be learned from the Nordic countries he celebrates. A cast of centrist and conservative critics note, first, that these Nordic countries are more capitalist than Sanders concedes, with generous pro-business policies and their own crop of billionaires; and, second, that the welfare states in Nordic countries are largely financed by extensive taxes on middle-class wages and consumption, not the wealth taxes both Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have pledged to levy on America’s top 1 percent.
Experts and commentators on the left point to the vastly stronger unions that exist in Nordic countries, which serve as the bedrock for these nations’ societies. “The Nordic nations are capitalist social democracies, but the reason they are capitalist is that their Social Democratic parties created unprecedented levels of worker power, social welfare and income equality as far back as the 1930s, and had the power to maintain those levels to this very day,” Harold Meyerson wrote in the American Prospect last year.

Marin, who at 34 is the world’s youngest female leader, is looking to the future. She said her government’s “new task is to make the Nordic model part of an environmentally sustainable future,” one where the struggle to fight climate change offers “a chance to create new jobs, new technologies, new opportunities for everyone in our country.”

Unsurprisingly, Marin expressed disappointment in Trump’s seeming indifference to the urgency of climate action. “We don’t have the luxury of time. We need ambitious targets and actions, and we need to implement the policies now,” she said.
As a social democrat, she’s aware of the rising challenge on the right throughout Nordic nations, where nativist, far-right movements have gained traction in recent years. “Populist movements are trying to present simple answers to complex questions and a complex world,” Marin said.
That includes the thorny question of immigration, which Marin welcomes. “We have an aging population, and we need people to come to Finland, to work there and to raise their children and take part in making our society better,” she said.
Call it, perhaps, the Finnish Dream.

6,"More than a dozen state attorneys general gathered in New York earlier this week, ostensibly to announce their support for President Obama’s efforts to combat global warming and to underscore their intention to collaborate on investigations involving climate-related issues.

But the undercurrent of Tuesday’s public announcement, which included former vice president and climate activist Al Gore taking a turn at the podium, was anything but subtle: New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and his counterparts from around the country vowed to “collectively, collaboratively and aggressively” investigate whether fossil fuel companies such as ExxonMobil have misled shareholders and the public about what they knew — and when — about the risks of climate change.
“We have heard the scientists; we know what’s happening to the planet,” Schneiderman said. “But there is confusion, sowed by those with an interest in profiting from the confusion and creating misperceptions in the eyes of the American public.”

Schneiderman began investigating ExxonMobil last fall, subpoenaing documents from the company in the wake of reporting by the Los Angeles Times and the online publication Inside Climate News that showed Exxon’s in-house researchers were concerned about climate change from fossil-fuel emissions decades ago, and yet for a long time, the company publicly raised doubts about the science. \
Schneiderman has leeway to undertake such an investigation under both consumer protection laws and New York’s Martin Act, a securities law that protects investors.
New York is investigating Exxon Mobil for allegedly misleading the public about climate change
The California attorney general’s office has since initiated its own investigation, and on Tuesday, at least two more attorneys general — Maura Healey of Massachusetts and Claude Walker of the Virgin Islands — said they also had opened inquiries into Exxon’s actions.

Suzanne McCarron, ExxonMobil’s vice president of public and government affairs, said in a statement that the accusations against the company are “politically motivated and based on discredited reporting funded by activist organizations” and that ExxonMobil is “actively assessing all legal options.”
She added that the allegations are “preposterous” and “based on the false premise that ExxonMobil reached definitive conclusions about anthropogenic climate change before the world’s experts and before the science itself had matured, and then withheld it from the broader scientific community.” McCarron said the company openly shared findings in peer-reviewed publications and actively contributed to the work of the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
“The allegations repeated today are an attempt to limit free speech and are the antithesis of scientific inquiry,” McCarron said. “Left unchallenged, they could stifle the search for solutions to the real risks from climate change.”

While ExxonMobil might have been the company publicly in the crosshairs this week, the carefully coordinated announcement in New York could signal the beginning stages of a broader reckoning for big energy companies facing questions about what they knew about climate change, and when.
At least Gore seemed to think so.
Years from now, the former vice president insisted, the convening of this group of state law enforcement officials will be viewed as “a real turning point” in the efforts to hold to account companies that have deceived investors and the public about climate change. He went as far as to liken the effort to similar action taken decades ago against the tobacco industry, which despite growing health warnings long denied the harmful nature of its products, until state attorneys general led the way in forcing the industry to acknowledge it had known of the potential dangers all along.

7," When Carmen Luna moved to a neighborhood on the outskirts of Mexico City in 1975, there was no sewage system. To get water, she carried buckets to and from a faucet in the street. At the end of the 1980s, her house was connected to the grid; her family would get tamarind-colored water three days a week. Last year, Ms. Luna signed up for a new rainwater-harvesting program led by Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum, an environmental scientist. The city government had teamed up with local nonprofit Isla Urbana to install 100,000 of its rainwater-harvesting systems in the districts of Xochimilco and Iztapalapa. Today, 20% of the water used in Ms. Luna’s eight-member household comes from a 2,500-liter collection tank on the ground floor. While not potable, the water is available seven days a week and can be used for household chores and bathing, easing strain on the grid. Harvesting rainwater is a centuries-old practice, but Isla Urbana’s system is cheaper, faster and easier to install than most existing technology. A look at how innovation and technology are transforming the way we live, work and play. The coronavirus pandemic, which has shut down much of Mexico City for months, has only heightened the need for access to quality water in the home, including for hand washing. Even before the current crisis, however, cities were struggling to provide running water to their inhabitants. According to the United Nations, Mexico City, Cairo, Bangalore, and seven other megalopolises will likely run out of water by 2030. These cities grew exponentially at the end of the 20th century, and governments couldn't keep up in building centralized infrastructure. Climate change will only exacerbate this situation, with more erratic rainfall and hotter temperatures more quickly evaporating water in reservoirs, according to a recent U.N. report. “Mexico City’s case is tragic because, unlike other cities, it is located on a region where water abounds,” says Manuel Perló, an urbanist and sociologist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico who specializes in water resources. The city receives more yearly rainfall than London. But the resource has been mismanaged, Mr. Perló says. Most of the city’s water is pumped from dams up to 125 miles away, and 40% is lost through leaks in pipes and containers, according to Mr. Perló. In Mexico City, when it rains, it storms, but the water mixes with the sewage and cannot be used. Since the late 1990s, places such as Australia and Santa Fe, N.M., have made it compulsory for new residences to have rainwater-harvesting systems. Brazil has installed 650,000 systems in the semiarid northern region, according to Johann Gnadlinger, a water-resource engineer who worked on the project. In 2015, China launched its Sponge City initiative to install permeable pavement to absorb rainwater before it hits the sewers. Today, 2% to 3% of the world’s population collects rainwater to use for chores, but that could rise to 8% by 2030, according to Han Heijen, president of the International Rainwater Harvesting Alliance, a Swiss nongovernmental organization. Whether rainwater collection can be a viable part of long-term water-supply solutions depends on the success of experiments such as Isla Urbana’s. The nonprofit’s system costs $750 on average, and it takes about an afternoon to put in. It is made of PVC plastic, and no specialized knowledge is needed to install it, Isla Urbana says. By contrast, a standard rainwater harvesting system for a typical single-family home would generally cost between $8,000 and $10,000, according to the Texas Water Development Board, a state agency. In Isla Urbana’s system, pipes collect water from the roof. First, leaves and debris are filtered out. Then the water goes through a patented filter called the Tlaloque 200 before being collected in a tank. The Tlaloque is based on the “first flush,” the idea that water from an initial rainfall is more contaminated because it washes away surface dirt and organisms. First-flush filters are an integral part of many rainwater-harvesting systems. The final output isn’t potable water, but it can be used for cleaning, laundry, toilets and showers. A purifier and carbon filter can be added to make the water potable and better tasting. It remains to be seen how durable the system is—an important consideration because maintenance is crucial for good water quality. Mr. Gnadlinger says that the Brazil system, which was made of cement, could last dozens of years. The main parts of Isla Urbana’s system can last 30 years, says co-founder David Vargas. One obstacle to broader global implementation of rainwater harvesting is the belief by citizens, health officials and utilities that it is less hygienic than centralized city water systems. Could Mexico City be a model for other cities working to provide clean water to their inhabitants? Join the conversation below. And what if it doesn’t rain? Cities tend to be warmer and wetter than their surrounding areas, making them ideal for rainwater collection. But in the future, rainfall patterns in certain regions could become harder to predict, according to a 2016 article published in the journal Nature. Even in Mexico City, it may be challenging to expand the Isla Urbana system because of uneven rainfall, says Mr. Perló. Some months are wet, most are dry. “Five to six great storms could account for 50% of rainwater precipitation during the whole year, but it isn’t so easy to predict where they will fall,” he says. Brazil may offer clues. In the state of Bahia, the dry season lasts at least eight months. Since 2012, a semi-drought has affected the region, heavily changing rain patterns. In 2017, rainfall was a fifth of the yearly average. The harvesting systems constructed before the drought caught the little rain that there was, meaning that people had water at least part of the time, Mr. Gnadlinger says. (Government-run emergency water trucks also filled in.) “The main reason why planners disregard rainwater harvesting is that it is not reliable in terms of a perennial supply,” says Mr. Heijen of the International Rainwater Harvesting Alliance. In the future, as the weather gets less predictable, households in some parts of the world may need to get used to having different sources of water in different seasons. “To be a good engineer during the last century was to find an optimal solution to a definable problem,” says Alex Steffen, a San Francisco-based writer and consultant focused on climate change. “Instead of seeking the most optimal solution, we need the most rugged, the one that withstands pressure.”  ",https://www.wsj.com/articles/mexico-city-struggling-to-provide-clean-water-tests-a-new-method-11597932000,Medium,-1,Yes,0
8," PG&E Corp. told California regulators that its power equipment might have contributed to igniting a recent wildfire that has killed four people. The utility disclosed in securities filings that it notified the California Public Utilities Commission on Friday it had recorded alarms on certain equipment supporting a power line that served an area east of Redding, Calif., where the Zogg Fire is believed to have originated in Shasta County, near Oregon. The fire has burned more than 56,000 acres and destroyed 204 structures since it started late last month, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The blaze, which forced evacuations in the area, was almost fully contained as of Friday, according to Cal Fire. PG&E said state fire investigators have taken possession of some of its equipment as part of their probe into the cause of the fire. The company said the information is preliminary and that it has no information about the cause of the fire. It said it doesn’t have access to Cal Fire evidence and that it is cooperating with the investigation. “We recognize the tragic losses sustained as a result of this year’s fire season and are thankful as always for the efforts of the first responders who have worked tirelessly to contain the fires and protect the lives and property of California residents,” the company said. If PG&E’s equipment is found responsible for the fire, it could face substantial liability-related costs just months after emerging from bankruptcy. The company sought chapter 11 protection in January 2019 as it grappled with billions of dollars in wildfire-related liability costs. The company’s equipment sparked a series of destructive wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that collectively killed more than 100 people and burned more than 15,000 homes in Northern California. PG&E has been working to make its electric grid safer and trim trees away from power lines to reduce the risk of its equipment sparking more wildfires. The company has resorted to pre-emptively shutting off power when wind speeds pick up, which raises fire risks. California has suffered an unprecedented spate of wildfires this year. More than 3.8 million acres have been scorched by a total of more than 8,100 fires, according to Cal Fire. Since mid-August, at least 29 people have died. Severe weather conditions have given rise to the blazes in California and across the western U.S., with record-setting heat, gusty winds and dry vegetation fueling fast-spreading blazes. Scientists say the most significant causes are poor forest management and climate change, which causes higher temperatures and longer droughts.

9,"Former president Barack Obama made a few pointed jibes — without actually naming President Trump — in remarks in New Delhi on Friday, taking on social media, climate-change deniers and religious intolerance.
In a discussion period at a leadership forum, the former president was asked about his wife Michelle’s comments this week during a speech in Toronto, when she said it was not a good idea to “tweet from bed,” an obvious commentary on Trump’s early morning Twitter habit.
“Michelle was giving the general idea . . . don’t say the first thing that pops in your head. Have a little bit of an edit function,” he said. “Think before you speak, think before you tweet.”
The former president got a laugh when he pointed out that he has 100 million followers — “more than other people who use it more often.”

Actually, Trump has 44 million followers, Obama 97 million.

On the subject of climate change, Obama described the Paris agreement to limit carbon emissions as giving children a “fighting chance,” although “we have a little bit of a pause in American leadership.” Trump announced earlier this year that the United States would be withdrawing from the agreement, in which countries gave voluntary pledges to limit their greenhouse gas emissions in coming decades.
Obama praised India for its role in the Paris accords and said he couldn’t have a debate with people who claimed climate change was not real. Trump has said that climate change is a hoax caused by China.
“I can have a debate with someone about climate change and about what we need to do, but if you call climate change a hoax, I don't know what to do with that,” Obama said.
Obama also said that he had “privately” raised the issue of religious intolerance with India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. Modi is a Hindu nationalist whose more radical supporters have been accused of inflaming tensions with Muslims and other minority communities in Hindu-majority India.

“A country shouldn't be divided on sectarian lines and that is something I have told Prime Minister Modi in person . . . People see the differences between each other much too vividly and miss the commonalities,” Obama said.
Tension between minority groups and religious communities in India, one of the world’s most diverse countries, have long existed, but some critics in India think that intolerance has increased during Modi’s administration.
“For a country like India where there is a Muslim population that is successful, integrated and considers itself as Indian, which is not the case in some other countries, this should be nourished and cultivated,” Obama said.
Modi did not address the subject of the meeting with Obama, simply tweeting that “it was a pleasure to meet, once again, former President Barack Obama.”

10," It is a vision laid out by many supporters of Britain’s departure from the European Union: a dynamic economy freed of the shackles imposed by the dead hand of regulation from Brussels. It raises a huge question, however: How much of this outward-looking, free-market future would be politically achievable? The issues boil down to these. Would the U.K. be able to improve on the trade agreements that it currently has within the EU and that the bloc has with non-EU countries? And would it be possible, post “Brexit,” to push a bonfire of employment, climate and other regulations through Parliament in London? On both scores, there is room for hesitation.  There is no doubt that the EU is responsible for large swaths of regulation that affect the British economy. The EU “has increasingly become a force for heavy-handed and petty regulation rather than for free-market liberalism,” Mark Littlewood of the free-market Institute of Economic Affairs said last month. Surveys of U.K. businesses regularly show that overregulation is a strong concern, and that the EU has contributed significantly to it. There is a limit, however, to how far Europe has forced the U.K.’s unwilling hand. Data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show the U.K. has the second-freest product markets among 54 countries it sampled, after the Netherlands, another EU country. As for labor-market flexibility, it is the most flexible economy in Europe, slightly less flexible than Canada but more so than Australia. The think tank Open Europe has estimated that the 100 most expensive EU-derived regulations cost the U.K. economy about £33.3 billion ($47 billion) a year. (The benefits, calculated from government data, exceed this.) Paring these regulations back could save £12.8 billion a year, or 0.7% of gross domestic product. Some £5.8 billion of this saving could come from softening environment and climate-change laws, for example, by scrapping targets for renewable energy and pulling out of the EU emissions-trading system. Another promising contender: employment, social and health-and-safety laws. Here, it estimated £5.6 billion could feasibly be saved by, among other things, scrapping EU laws involving temporary-employment agencies and reining in the directive on working time. But as Open Europe pointed out in its report this week, these steps “will involve politically challenging decisions and may also mean shifting the trend of domestic policy.” Doing it will also mean limiting the level of economic integration with the EU, because the closer a country is tied to the bloc, the more of its rules it has to accept. On climate change, deregulation would involve a change of direction for the U.K., which “has gone further than EU standards and continues to do so,” the report said. Pushing through those decisions would be even more challenging because the main opposition Labour Party has abandoned the pro-business stance it took in government from 1997 to 2010. And the Scottish Nationalists, now an important force in London, also favor strong state intervention. Jeremy Corbyn, Labour’s new leader, laid out Thursday what he called “the strong socialist case” for staying in the EU. A key part of the argument was that the EU provided a bulwark against right-wing efforts to undermine workers’ rights, to go easy on tax dodgers and to ignore the perils of climate change. “The free-market enthusiasts in the Leave campaign would put all those protections at risk,” he said. On trade, Open Europe’s analysis questions too the openness of the economy, suggesting that immediately after exit, U.K.’s trade in goods and services will be less free than it is now. That is in part because the U.K. would likely lose its membership of the EU single market. The price of accepting insider status in the single market from outside the bloc would likely be too high: accepting EU regulation without getting a vote on it, and acceding to free movement of EU workers—the issue over which many people will vote to leave. The other reason is that negotiating free-trade deals with non-EU countries would take many years. These agreements might eventually be broader in scope than those the EU currently has. But the more extensive a free-trade agreement, the longer the time needed usually to negotiate them. And as current worries about the impact on British industry of cheap Chinese steel show, free trade isn’t always popular. One further attribute of an open, outward-facing economy is openness to immigration, which economists say helps maintain a flexible supply of labor. Outside the EU, the U.K. should be able to implement selective immigration policies that would be less open to EU workers and more open to the rest of the world. That could be economically beneficial and more politically acceptable than now, Open Europe concluded. But net immigration is likely to remain high whether the U.K. stays in or leaves the EU. The U.K.’s economic path after leaving the EU would be critically shaped by the political decisions that follow. There hasn’t yet been a popular debate about that, and there are no guarantees about the direction that will be taken.

11,"It was the steak dinners, Ethan Brown says, that changed his life. He had embarked on a career in the clean-energy industry, a path befitting an environmentalist out to save the world. But the incongruity he perceived among his colleagues, who would lament environmental problems while eating beef, pushed Brown — a vegetarian since age 18 — in a different direction.
“We would go to conferences and sit there wringing our hands over all these [energy] issues, and then we’d go to dinner and people would order huge steaks,” Brown told Popular Science in 2013.
Brown left the energy industry and founded a start-up called Beyond Meat in 2009, building on the work of University of Missouri food scientist Fu-hung Hsieh, a pioneer in “high moisture extrusion of fibrous meat analog” — making fake meat taste more like flesh, in other words. Beyond Meat achieved early hype with its Beyond Chicken strips, designed to obliterate memories of limp tofu dogs or crumbly veggie burgers. Observing the strips shred into ligament-like strands at Beyond Meat’s factory in Columbus, Mo., Food Network star and author Alton Brown remarked to Wired in 2013, “It’s more like meat than anything I’ve ever seen that wasn’t meat.”

Beyond Meat bills its latest creation, the Beyond Burger, as the most meat-like non-meat feat yet. It has been on sale for a single day — on Monday, in a Whole Foods in Boulder, Colo. — and is already being compared to, as the New York Times puts it, the “holy grail” of ersatz animal protein: A plant burger upon which a human carnivore would happily snack.
A Beyond Burger patty contains 20 grams of vegetable protein, mostly from peas, while lacking gluten and soy. If you prick a Beyond Burger, does it bleed? Yes, the company says, though its blood is pulverized beet juice. Beyond Meat took a completionist approach to its hamburger doppelganger: The Beyond Burger had to look, smell and feel like meat.
Once humans started cultivating wild plants, fruits and vegetables got a lot more colorful. (Video: Daron Taylor, Dani Johnson, Osman Malik/The Washington Post)
This was no easy task. Animal meat is not a uniform product, but plants, on the other hand, don’t come marbled with fat or sprout gristly connective tissues. (Even lab-grown beef patties, a different beast from Beyond Meat’s burger, have struggled to mirror the heterogeneous chow you’d buy from a butcher.) It was up to researchers like Stanford University structural biologist Joseph D. Puglisi, a scientific adviser to Beyond Meat, to devise a way to deposit plant fat in layers. “We were able to get fat distributed throughout a patty — but in meat, fat is distributed in sheets,” he told the New York Times.
Advertisement
Beyond Meat’s ability to replicate meaty layers out of plant matter is among the company’s greatest trade secrets — what puts it in a different category, perhaps, than the long line of faux meats that have come before. Biz Stone, one of Twitter’s founders and a Beyond Meat backer, described the company’s fake chicken to Fast Company as having a meaty mouth feel. “It feels fatty and muscly and like it’s not good for you when you’re chewing it,” Stone said in 2012. “For a long-time vegan, it’s a little bit freaky.”
Sergey Brin isn’t the only tech entrepreneur investing in artificial meat
(How closely a bite of the fake chicken, au naturel, mimics the real bird is a matter of debate; when tucked in a wrap, however, the game seems to change. New York Times’s Mark Bittman wrote in 2012 that Beyond Meat’s Brown fooled the food columnist “badly” in a taste test.)
This may seem like a lot of noise over mashed peas, unless you care about what Brown described in an interview with Business Insider last year as his four horsemen: animal welfare, climate change, human health and natural resources. Livestock — thanks to factors like cow burps — are a significant contributor of the greenhouse gas methane. Because crops take up about half as much space as livestock, a recent study in the journal Nature Communications concluded that a global vegetarian diet would be the most feasible way to feed 2050’s estimated population without expanding today’s farmland.

Livestock farms have direct detrimental impacts on human health as well. Due to widespread antibiotic use in livestock, the Centers for Disease Control estimates that 20 percent of antibiotic resistant infections originate from food. The demand for meat produced cheaply and quickly, too, may lead to poor working conditions; as one worker in the poultry industry told Oxfam America, the individual allegedly had to wear diapers on the job because bathroom breaks were verboten.
The not-so-humane way ‘humanely raised’ chickens are being raised
Brown says his goal with the Beyond Burger is nothing less than redefining meat to include plant protein, urging Whole Foods to sell the vegetable patties alongside their flesh-and-blood equivalents. On Facebook, some vegetarians expressed discomfort about the Beyond Burgers’s close proximity to what one commenter described as “little cellophaned packets of death.” The company defended its power play for the meat aisle, as it wrote on Facebook, as “the opening shot in our bid to transform the meat case into the protein case.”
If such a complete transformation is the goal, the company will need to send in reinforcement burgers — the first batch sold out in an hour, according to Beyond Meat’s Twitter feed.
The burgers cost $5.99 for a pack of two patties. Beyond Meat says it plans to expand to Denver and Washington, D.C., soon, and beyond Colorado over the summer.

WASHINGTON, DC- JUNE 14: Presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders arrives at the Capital Hilton to meet with Hillary Clinton on Tuesday June 14, 2016. (Matt McClain/ The Washington Post)
THE MORNING PLUM:
Polls continue to show that Hillary Clinton may win a sizable victory in New York tomorrow — which would then begin to make the delegate math for Bernie Sanders look still more daunting. Which will raise the question: If the nomination process ends with Clinton securing a majority of the pledged delegates and winning the popular vote, but falling short of an outright majority of delegates without the help of super-delegates, how far will Sanders take this?
Opinions to start the day, in your inbox. Sign up.
In an interview with an ABC News affiliate in New York, Sanders has now said in perhaps the most explicit terms yet that he will take this battle all the way to the convention:
 ANCHOR: If you do not win, how far will you take this?
SANDERS: We’re going all the way. Every person in this country, every state in this country, has a right to cast their ballot for who they want to see the Democratic nominee be.
ANCHOR: All the way to the floor in Philadelphia?
SANDERS: Yup.
ANCHOR: Do you think that’s good or bad for the party, if this race goes that long and that far?
SANDERS: I think it’s great for the party, and I’ll tell you why. The only way the Democrats are going to win, is if there is a large voter turnout. We are helping create that large voter turnout….young people and working people are now participating.
It’s not entirely clear what Sanders means by this. He may mean he is going to continue battle for super-delegates up to the start of the convention, i.e., deep into June, at which point he might concede if it’s becoming obvious that she will win a majority of the delegates during the Philadelphia gathering. Or he may mean that he will continue this battle into the convention itself, which could mean division during the festivities, at a time when the party wants to unify behind the nominee before an engaged national audience.

I think the former scenario is defensible; Sanders has every reason and incentive to keep his supporters engaged as long as possible. But it is hard to imagine that Sanders will allow this to stray into the latter scenario, which could be potentially destructive to the party’s chances in the general election.
Follow Greg Sargent's opinions
For one thing, Sanders senior adviser Tad Devine has explicitly said that “there’s no way” that Sanders will be associated with anything that helps Donald Trump or Ted Cruz get elected president, which would be “destructive to the future of this nation.” What’s more, Sanders constantly says climate change is the single greatest threat to the planet, adding that must act to avert an urgent threat to the futures of our children and grandchildren — his own included. While Sanders likes to say the global climate deal falls short, the Paris accord may end up being our best near term hope for building an international effort to tackle the problem. Implementing it could allow us to get to the point where dramatic innovations in energy technology begin to make solving the problem a realistic possibility.

Sanders knows Clinton would do everything possible to facilitate U.S. engagement in the global climate deal — including protecting Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which is key to meeting our international commitments — while a GOP president would do everything possible to undermine both. Sanders has to know that allowing the latter to happen could prove absolutely catastrophic. He can’t possibly want to play any role in facilitating it.

Finally, if you look closely at what Sanders is saying, you can discern that he is signaling a potential endgame to all of this. Here’s what he said on CBS’s Face the Nation yesterday:
“I will tell you something that also is of concern to me….even here in New York state, you have a voting system which makes it impossible for independents to participate in the Democratic primary, that makes it impossible for people to register on the day of the election, which many states do, which is going to result in a lower voter turnout than I would like to see.”
This signals that Sanders may push the party to stand for reforms to the nomination process — such as open primaries that allow independents to participate and same day registration — as part of a kind of unity settlement with Clinton in which he does all he can to rally his supporters behind her. Jane Sanders has already signaled the same. Yes, there are legitimate debates over what sort of reforms are actually desirable, and there are all kinds of obstacles to such a push actually bearing fruit. And for all we know, Clinton may rebuff any such demands by Sanders.
But whether Sanders actually goes through with this reform push or not, the broader point is that Sanders himself is signaling (in his comments above to the ABC affiliate and to CBS) that taking this as far as possible will ultimately be a good thing for the Democratic Party’s effort to protect the country from President Trump or Cruz, precisely because it will engage more young people in the process. Taking him at his word that this is his actual goal, he isn’t going to push his effort to contest the nomination so far that it might encourage his supporters to question the legitimacy of the whole process, which could have the opposite effect.

* BIG DAY AT THE SUPREME COURT: Today the Court hears arguments in the high-takes lawsuit by Texas and two dozen states against Obama’s executive actions on deportations. But law professor Erwin Chemerinsky predicts the challenge may go down on standing grounds:
The only harm claimed by Texas is the cost of its processing drivers’ licenses for those who are remaining in the country. Yet nothing in federal law requires that any state government lose money in the issuance of drivers’ licenses. It is an entirely self-imposed “cost” and thus not a harm of the sort that the court — and especially its conservative justices — allow as a basis for standing to sue in federal court. If that were enough, any state could concoct a way to interfere with federal policies any time it wanted to bring a lawsuit.
Meanwhile, legal experts agree that Chief Justice John Roberts may side with the government on standing grounds, to avoid a deadlocked court on the underlying partisan dispute over the proper extent of the president’s authority to defer deportations.
* ALL EYES ARE ALSO ON KENNEDY: While Roberts may be amenable to the government’s standing argument, Robert Barnes explains what could weigh on Anthony Kennedy:
Kennedy wrote the court’s decision in 2012 striking part of Arizona’s attempt to crack down on illegal immigrants in the state. The Obama administration’s brief relies heavily on Kennedy’s finding that the federal government and the executive have considerable power in designing the nation’s immigration policy.
So watch today for any statements from Kennedy that seem to speak to the executive’s broad discretion in enforcing immigration law in particular.

* HILLARY HOLDS LEAD IN  NEW YORK:  A new Emerson College poll finds Hillary Clinton continues to hold a large lead over Bernie Sanders among likely Democratic voters in New York, 55-40. Meanwhile, a new CBS News poll finds puts Clinton’s lead in New York at 53-43.

The Emerson poll was taken entirely after the Thursday debate. Clinton’s lead in the polling averages is holding at 55-41. If Clinton does run up a sizable win tomorrow, the delegate math for Sanders will begin to look very daunting.
* TRUMP CRUSHING IT IN NEW YORK: The new Emerson College poll finds Donald Trump beating John Kasich and Ted Cruz among likely GOP voters by 55-21-18. The new CBS poll puts it at 54-21-19.
The polling averages have it at 53-22-19, and virtually all recent polls have put Trump over 50 percent. If that holds, that would give Trump a large delegate haul, potentially still making it possible — if difficult — for him to win the nomination before a contested convention.
Advertisement
 * WHAT A BIG NEW YORK WIN WOULD DO FOR TRUMP: The First Read crew explains that a big New York win could lower the percentage of remaining delegates he needs to win the nomination outright:
Say Trump wins 85 delegates out of New York — which is entirely doable given the state’s winner-take-all rules both statewide and in each congressional district — while Cruz gets five and Kasich gets five. Well, that would lower the 61 percent of remaining delegates that Trump needs to 57 percent. And it would all but mathematically eliminate Cruz’s chance of getting a majority on a first ballot.
Of course, if Trump does fall short of an outright majority, and Cruz can deny him that majority in the first round of convention balloting (while not winning it himself), it does become less likely that Trump can secure that majority on later balloting.
 * HILLARY AND BERNIE MUST UNIFY EVENTUALLY: E.J. Dionne spells out a possible route to unity: they will ultimately recognize that they have far more in common ideologically with each other than either does with any GOP candidate:
At a time when ideological polarization between the parties is so high, such contrasts should be obvious. But the bad blood between many of Sanders’s supporters and Clinton obscures the stakes and presents Democrats with a special challenge….The pro-Sanders young are unlikely to vote Republican, but if too many stay home in November, much of what Sanders and Clinton believe in could be consigned to the dustbin. That’s why the day after New York, the Brooklyn Brawlers would do well to sit down over a couple of Brooklyn Brewery ales and figure out a way forward.
It might come a lot later than that — say, in June — but it’s likely to turn out fine.
* THE MOST RIGHT WING NOMINEE IN…A LONG TIME: The New York Times takes a long look at Ted Cruz’s record, including his opposition to legalization and to abortion in cases of rape and incest, and his desire to roll back the clock on gay marriage, and concludes:
He would be the most conservative presidential nominee in at least a half-century, perhaps to the right of Barry Goldwater, testing the electoral limits of a personal ideology he has forged meticulously since adolescence. And he has, more effectively than almost any politician of his generation, anticipated the rightward tilt of the Republican Party of today, grasping its conservatism even as colleagues dismissed him as a fringe figure.
As it happens, senior Democrats agree wholeheartedly with the first half of this analysis.

13,"Dear Science: I seem to be a total mosquito magnet, and nothing I try keeps the biters at bay. With serious illnesses like Zika to worry about, that has me wondering why we don't just get rid of the pests once and for all. What good do mosquitoes do? 
Here's what science has to say:
Mosquitoes are our most deadly adversaries in the animal kingdom. While the ""factoid"" that floats around about malaria causing ""half of all human deaths"" throughout history is pretty silly, it's true that we have the insects to thank for some devastating diseases. Over 400,000 people were killed by malaria alone in 2015 – a death toll that until recently was nearly doubled. Warming climates and increased global travel have helped previously obscure viruses like Zika and chikungunya gain footholds across the globe. And even if you never face a life-threatening disease because of a mosquito bite, swelling and itching is hardly a pleasant experience.
Stephen Higgs, director of Kansas State University's Biosecurity Research Institute, explains the anatomy of a mosquito. (Video: Kansas State University)
So why don't we just zap them? Unfortunately, you shouldn't expect to read about the total eradication of mosquitoes anytime soon.
Dear Science: How many germs are actually on a toilet seat — and should I care?
Getting rid of all mosquitoes would be pretty nonsensical: You might only care to notice the species that bite you, but that's just 200 or so out of 3,000 varieties of mosquito, which inhabit every continent except for Antarctica. Even those biting species are largely harmless, and only certain species are even capable of carrying deadly illnesses. Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus alone are responsible for the transmission of Zika, dengue and chikungunya, while a few members of the genus Anopheles carry malaria.

Only female mosquitoes bite, even among these potentially deadly species, and only for a very brief portion of their life cycle – when they need nutrients to create eggs.
""They’re trying to do the right thing,"" Ole Vielemeyer, infectious disease expert at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian, told The Post. ""They’re just trying to have enough food for their offspring.""
But during that stage of life, they might bite multiple victims (including those of different species). If a mosquito bites someone infected with an illness that can replicate inside the insect's gut instead of simply being digested, that virus or parasite can then sneak into a new host when the bug's saliva slips into a bite. It's not the infected blood itself being passed along, which is why you can't get HIV from a bug bite. Still, plenty of pathogens have evolved to thrive in mosquito saliva.

""Most of mosquitoes are harmless, but when they transmit diseases, horrible things can happen,"" Vielemeyer added. ""The ones that carry disease have caused human suffering for millennia. So it's kind of a mixed bag.""
Dear Science answers your questions about evolution
Many mosquitoes – harmless and otherwise – serve an important biological purpose. They can help pollinate plants as they feed on nectar (their usual food source, outside of that crucial blood meal period) and provide a vital source of food for larger animals. They're vital components of a complex ecosystem, just like every other living thing. Researchers in the Arctic worried that climate change would lead more animals to feast upon local mosquitoes, throwing the food web out of whack and leaving plants unpollinated. As it turns out, warmer water has actually produced an Arctic mosquito boom – but that's not great news for the baby caribou they feed upon.
The point is that just because humans hate mosquitoes doesn't mean that they can be wiped out without consequences.
Advertisement
""We see the mosquito as sort of this evil thing,"" Vielemeyer said. ""But there are lots of positive things that they do in the ecosystem.""
That doesn't mean that scientists have a live-and-let-live philosophy about these insects: Researchers are trying to eradicate mosquitoes. But they're focusing on the ones that cause the most harm. The aegypti mosquitoes that cause Zika and the like – mosquitoes that have evolved to live in urban areas – are a particularly attractive target.
“There is no visible end to this except a war against aegypti,” Jo Lines of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine recently told the Guardian. “Otherwise this is going to go on for a thousand years.”
Dear Science: When you lose weight, where does it actually go?
Many scientists are working on creating genetically modified males mosquitoes that can only father sterile offspring. If released into the population, these males could trick deadly mosquitoes into wasting their blood meals on useless eggs. Over the course of a few generations, the targeted species would dwindle. Trials in the Cayman Islands where several million of these modified mosquitoes were released resulted in a 96 percent population reduction.
Advertisement
Some have suggested simultaneously releasing bacteria that target males of the species (yes, that's a thing that exists), which would help cut down on the number of fertile mates available. Other studies are working on using bacteria to help mosquitoes digest these deadly viruses and parasites instead of giving them a place to grow.
Some argue that there's more work to be done before genetically modified mosquitoes are ready to save the day. But some more ""natural"" methods show promise: One recent study found that a species of jumping spider in East Africa likes to go after mosquitoes that have just taken a blood meal. Dumping hordes of arachnids into your home isn't going to save you from all mosquito-borne illness, but allowing natural mosquito predators to thrive certainly doesn't hurt.
Dear Science: Why does the hair on my head grow longer than the hair on my body?
All of this is little consolation if you're prone to probing proboscises. Lots of factors – from blood type to clothing color to body size – can make you a particularly appealing blood meal. If you're in an area where mosquitoes carry disease, you should always protect yourself with a repellant that contains one of the active ingredients recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cover up as much as your skin as possible, and never sleep in a room with open doors or windows if you don't have access to screens or a mosquito net.
""It's always prudent to avoid getting bitten,"" Vielemeyer said, even if your region isn't known to host dangerous bugs. There's no knowing when a species might expand its historic stomping grounds, or when a disease might adapt to living in a new host. ""Prevention is always better than dealing with the after effects,"" he said.

14,"Climate change. Mental health. Space exploration. Vaccinations. The health of the oceans. Antibiotic-resistant superbugs.
These are not the typical meat-and-potatoes topics of presidential debates. Often, the candidates and people who ask them questions skip over such topics entirely.
But dozens of non-partisan groups that represent millions of scientists and engineers across the country are eager to change that. For the third consecutive presidential election, the folks behind ScienceDebate.org are asking candidates to hold a debate exclusively about major issues in science, engineering, health and the environment. Since that almost certainly won't happen (it didn't in 2008 or 2012, either), the organizers have put together 20 questions they are asking candidates to address in writing.
Marcia McNutt, president of the National Academy of Sciences, said answers from the campaigns could help voters gauge how a candidate plans to use scientific information to make important decisions in the White House.
Advertisement
""When you look at the scope of the questions, they touch on so many issues that are important to our quality of life -- things that are going to impact our health, our economy, our future resources,"" McNutt said in an interview. ""It certainly would be good for America to see the answers to these questions.""
Rush Holt, chief executive of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, said one hope is to encourage both journalists and voters to press candidates in the coming month to speak in depth about where they stand on important scientific topics.
“Sometimes politicians think science issues are limited to simply things like the budget for NASA or NIH, and they fail to realize that a president’s attitude toward and decisions about science and research affect the public well being,"" Holt said in a statement.

The effort has the support of a wide swath of the scientific community -- from the American Chemical Society to the Geological Society of America to the Paleontological Society. It also has a track record. In 2008, Democratic nominee Barack Obama and Republican nominee John McCain submitted answers to more than a dozen questions. In 2012, President Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney did the same. You can see those answers here and here.
So how will the effort fare this year? Who knows. The 2016 election season has been nothing if not unpredictable.
But chances are the group is likely to hear from Hillary Clinton. The Democratic nominee has sections on her campaign website dedicated to her stances on climate change, protection of wildlife, biomedical research, the opioid addiction crisis and investing in science and technology research, among other issues. Clinton also declared in her recent speech at the Democratic National Convention, "" I believe in science. I believe climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean energy jobs.""

Meanwhile, Republican nominee Donald Trump repeatedly has said he isn’t “a believer” that humans have played a significant role in the Earth’s changing climate.
In his own tweets, Trump has called the concept of global warming everything from a “hoax” to “bulls—” to a scheme “created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.” (He later said he was joking about the China tweet). In a wide-ranging meeting with The Washington Post editorial board in March, he again dismissed man-made climate change. Instead, he said the type of climate change we should worry most about is nuclear weapons — an apparent reference to Cold War-era fears over a “nuclear winter.”
Trump’s stance on climate change, of course, puts him at odds with the vast majority of scientists.
But the questions being asked by ScienceDebate.org go far beyond that topic, touching on research and development investments, long-term energy plans, how science and math are taught in schools and views on public health campaigns aimed at reducing smoking and drunk driving.
The 20 questions, which the group said it also will submit to Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, are posted below:
Science and engineering have been responsible for over half of the growth of the U.S. economy since WWII. But some reports question America’s continued leadership in these areas. What policies will best ensure that America remains at the forefront of innovation?
Many scientific advances require long-term investment to fund research over a period of longer than the two, four, or six year terms that govern political cycles. In the current climate of budgetary constraints, what are your science and engineering research priorities and how will you balance short-term versus long-term funding?
The Earth’s climate is changing and political discussion has become divided over both the science and the best response. What are your views on climate change, and how would your administration act on those views?
Biological diversity provides food, fiber, medicines, clean water and many other products and services on which we depend every day. Scientists are finding that the variety and variability of life is diminishing at an alarming rate as a result of human activity. What steps will you take to protect biological diversity?
The Internet has become a foundation of economic, social, law enforcement, and military activity. What steps will you take to protect vulnerable infrastructure and institutions from cyber attack, and to provide for national security while protecting personal privacy on electronic devices and the internet?
Mental illness is among the most painful and stigmatized diseases, and the National Institute of Mental Health estimates it costs America more than $300 billion per year. What will you do to reduce the human and economic costs of mental illness?
Strategic management of the U.S. energy portfolio can have powerful economic, environmental, and foreign policy impacts. How do you see the energy landscape evolving over the next 4 to 8 years, and, as President, what will your energy strategy be?
American students have fallen in many international rankings of science and math performance, and the public in general is being faced with an expanding array of major policy challenges that are heavily influenced by complex science. How would your administration work to ensure all students including women and minorities are prepared to address 21st century challenges and, further, that the public has an adequate level of STEM literacy in an age dominated by complex science and technology?
Public health efforts like smoking cessation, drunk driving laws, vaccination, and water fluoridation have improved health and productivity and save millions of lives. How would you improve federal research and our public health system to better protect Americans from emerging diseases and other public health threats, such as antibiotic resistant superbugs?
The long-term security of fresh water supplies is threatened by a dizzying array of aging infrastructure, aquifer depletion, pollution, and climate variability. Some American communities have lost access to water, affecting their viability and destroying home values.  If you are elected, what steps will you take to ensure access to clean water for all Americans?
Nuclear power can meet electricity demand without producing greenhouse gases, but it raises national security and environmental concerns. What is your plan for the use, expansion, or phasing out of nuclear power, and what steps will you take to monitor, manage and secure nuclear materials over their life cycle?
Agriculture involves a complex balance of land and energy use, worker health and safety, water use and quality, and access to healthy and affordable food, all of which have inputs of objective knowledge from science. How would you manage the US agricultural enterprise to our highest benefit in the most sustainable way?
We now live in a global economy with a large and growing human population. These factors create economic, public health, and environmental challenges that do not respect national borders. How would your administration balance national interests with global cooperation when tackling threats made clear by science, such as pandemic diseases and climate change, that cross national borders?
Science is essential to many of the laws and policies that keep Americans safe and secure. How would science inform your administration's decisions to add, modify, or remove federal regulations, and how would you encourage a thriving business sector while protecting Americans vulnerable to public health and environmental threats?
Public health officials warn that we need to take more steps to prevent international epidemics from viruses such as Ebola and Zika. Meanwhile, measles is resurgent due to decreasing vaccination rates. How will your administration support vaccine science?
There is a political debate over America’s national approach to space exploration and use. What should America's national goals be for space exploration and earth observation from space, and what steps would your administration take to achieve them?
There is a growing opioid problem in the United States, with tragic costs to lives, families and society. How would your administration enlist researchers, medical doctors and pharmaceutical companies in addressing this issue?
There is growing concern over the decline of fisheries and the overall health of the ocean: scientists estimate that 90 percent of stocks are fished at or beyond sustainable limits, habitats like coral reefs are threatened by ocean acidification, and large areas of ocean and coastlines are polluted. What efforts would your administration make to improve the health of our ocean and coastlines and increase the long-term sustainability of ocean fisheries?
There is much current political discussion about immigration policy and border controls. Would you support any changes in immigration policy regarding scientists and engineers who receive their graduate degree at an American university? Conversely, what is your opinion of recent controversy over employment and the H1-B Visa program?
Evidence from science is the surest basis for fair and just public policy, but that is predicated on the integrity of that evidence and of the scientific process used to produce it, which must be both transparent and free from political bias and pressure. How will you foster a culture of scientific transparency and accountability in government, while protecting scientists and federal agencies from political interference in their work?

15,"Reading Assistant Inspector General Patrick Sullivan’s full statement to a House hearing might give the impression that the Environmental Protection Agency is a rogue’s gallery of cheats, thieves and reprobates.
2021 Election: Complete coverage and analysis
The session also had a not so hidden agenda.
Topping a long list of federal employees and contractors Sullivan’s office has investigated is this standout:
An EPA IT contractor in Corvallis, Ore., an admitted pornography addict, confessed to looking at smut on his government computer for 18 years. During a 12-month period spanning 2013 and 2014, “he watched pornography at least one to two hours per day,” Sullivan told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Wednesday.
EPA computers block porn sites, or so officials thought. To get around the prohibition, the contractor used search engines based abroad. He also used software to scrub his computer so his habit would not be noticed. Sullivan blamed EPA “network vulnerabilities” for allowing the porn watching to go undetected for almost two decades. The contractor was fired and EPA was repaid $22,088 for that year of porn binging.

In another case, a man who was an EPA employee and a registered sex offender was stopped by  Dallas police for using emergency lights on his personal vehicle. He also carried makeshift badges to pretend he was a police officer.  In 2013, he was arrested for violating his probation, then fired the next January 2014. The Merit Systems Protection Board overturned the dismissal, but the agency reached an agreement with the phony officer that resulted in his resignation along with a $55,000 payment to him.
Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) was stunned that the government had to pay to get rid of “this freak of a pervert.” Somebody on the committee “better sponsor a bill to get rid of perverts interacting with the public,” Chaffetz said, “because this is not acceptable.”
It certainly is not acceptable for federal employees and contractors to behave badly, much less criminally. But as Chaffetz noted, most EPA staffers are “good, hard-working, patriotic people.” After the hearing, Sullivan put that in perspective, saying less than 1 percent of EPA employees  are under investigation. “The people who work here are very professional,” he added.

Data from Sullivan’s office point to a recent decline in misconduct cases. There were 124 pending employee integrity investigations at the end of September. That figure dropped to 90 by the end of March 2016. At the end of March 2015, however, there were 75 pending investigations.
Unlike last year, when the inspector general’s office criticized EPA’s “culture of complacency,” Sullivan said, “the agency’s internal adjudication process has dramatically improved” and could be considered “a ‘best practices’ model for the federal government.”
Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.) pointed out that this was the committee’s sixth hearing on EPA employees in recent years. How much is enough?
But employee behavior was not the only thing on the agenda. While the bad apples were the focus, so was the tree. Left unstated on the published schedule was the outrage Republicans have toward an agency they see as a prime example of federal government overreach.
Advertisement
Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R-Ariz.), who chaired much of the hearing, used the session for an outburst against EPA generally and especially Administrator Gina McCarthy.
Gosar told Stanley Meiburg, the acting deputy administrator who also testified at the hearing, that Meiburg is in violation of the law because he continues to serve in that capacity after having been nominated for the full-time position.
Meiburg said he has been “assured by counsel that my service is lawful.”
Gosar said Meiburg’s “defiance of the law” is not surprising because “EPA under this president has a long history of blatant disregard for the law.” The Arizona Republican then charged that McCarthy, whom he wants impeached, lied to Congress and the American people.
A graphic on his website claims that “the EPA wants to control private waters . . . even puddles.” The agency also has been a leader in the Obama administration’s efforts to deal with climate change and that’s another issue that really gets Gosar.
Advertisement
While he identifies as “a proud Catholic,” the congressman boycotted Pope Francis’s address to Congress last year because of the pontiff’s focus on climate change, as Gosar explained in an article posted on the right-wing Townhall website.
Referring to Francis, Gosar said, “this climate change talk has adopted all of the socialist talking points, wrapped false science and ideology into ‘climate justice’ and is being presented to guilt people into leftist policies.”
Consider the source.

16," What will keep the engine of tech innovation running? Two people who should be able to answer that question are Aicha Evans, chief executive of autonomous-vehicle startup Zoox, and Anousheh Ansari, chief executive of the XPrize Foundation, which runs incentive competitions to solve humanity’s biggest problems. Both women are engineers and entrepreneurs. Wall Street Journal reporter Christopher Mims interviewed them at the Journal’s Tech Live conference. Edited excerpts follow. MR. MIMS: Zoox has made some very specific predictions about launching fully autonomous taxis in Las Vegas, and you are testing on conventional vehicles. But the whole point of Zoox is to completely reimagine the automobile. MS. EVANS: In 2020 we will demonstrate the capability of our purpose-built vehicle. And yes, it is not a car. We do not believe in taking the current car that was built for a human driver and somehow putting in a lot of sensors and computers and then all of a sudden it’s going to be fully autonomous. So this is a vehicle that is conceived for autonomy. In 2021, we hope to start a commercial pilot program where we will be transporting members of the public. MR. MIMS: One of the things that you have talked about with Zoox is accessibility. Obviously, it’s also about electrification of transport. That’s going to be essential for eliminating fossil fuels from our transportation infrastructure. Anousheh, I know that’s something that you are thinking a great deal about. And you have announced that you are going to offer a $100 million XPrize devoted entirely to solving for the issue of climate change. MS. ANSARI: The $100 million prize is very focused on extracting carbon out of the atmosphere at gigaton scales. We need to get another 10 gigatons of CO2 out of our atmosphere. And even if we all switch to sustainable energy tomorrow, we won’t be able to get to those levels still because of all the other places where we’re producing CO2. We really need a solution for extraction of CO2 that is scaled much higher. Right now, there are technologies. But they’re either expensive or at very early stages. So they’re not able to scale up to that level. The prize would be for technologies that would be able to take a ton out of the atmosphere a day, which is a big push for any technology that exists. MR. MIMS: What is this magical device that’s going to take a ton of carbon out of the atmosphere every day? MS. ANSARI: The solutions that are out there. Some of them are biological solutions. I’ve seen designs of mechanical trees, for example, trying to mimic what a tree would be able to do. We have solutions that are soil-based to extract and be able to sequester it in soil. And they’re just purely getting the carbon out of the atmosphere and turning it into products, polymer-based products, used for shoes and flip-flops. In our existing carbon prize, we are working on the circular carbon economy. And I’ve seen products from vodka to cement to sunglasses to pieces and parts for bikes and shoes and everything. MR. MIMS: Can you address how, in your own experience, being mission-driven as a leader affects the people who work for you? Is it self-selecting? Do you attract other mission-driven people and then you’re all super motivated? MS. EVANS: As a leader, you interview people. You hire them. You employ them. And then you reward them. Or you pay them. To me, that’s sort of the minimum foundation. That gives you their directed energy. But that’s really not what I’m after. What I’m after is what I call discretionary energy. That is something you have to earn. And that’s usually around a common goal that is worthy, not just a common goal that is accepted. Then, yes, there is a self-selection system. Because if you’re a mercenary, you don’t do well. You don’t thrive in that type of environment. I also tend to pick risky, difficult, sort of tough things. And by definition, you have to surround yourself with people who like that and who are not afraid of failure. MR. MIMS: Anousheh, you have a fund and other initiatives to invest in women entrepreneurs. Why do you think this is important? MS. ANSARI: As a female entrepreneur and CEO in a tech industry, I’ve firsthand seen the problems that women face when they try to fundraise for their ventures. There’s that side of the story. The other side is women who have been successful have also not learned how to do practical investment in other women. Our hope was with the $1 billion fund to actually create an environment where we would get people on both sides to pledge and to create an environment where people will start deliberately investing and reporting on the investment in women’s ventures. MR. MIMS: Is it a venture fund? MS. ANSARI: No, we’re not a fund ourselves. There are a lot of funds out there. We wanted to get the existing funds to pledge to allocate a portion of the entire fund to invest in female CEOs. That’s what we’ve done successfully. We had received $1 billion in pledges. And now, we’re just making sure that the pledges will actually happen and come through. MR. MIMS: Aicha, what is it going to be like when we step into autonomous vehicles that are not cars. Because frankly, I agree that in the future, it’s not going to be cars once there are robots that we’re stepping into. MS. EVANS: It’s going to be about moving from point A to point B when you need it. And when you don’t need it, you don’t have a bunch of assets that are just being used for a percent of the time, which means 96% of the time they’re occupying space. Transportation as a service, and we’re already seeing the genesis of it as we speak, is really just going to change how people think. It’s just going to be a utility, really no different from having access to the internet or having access to electricity— MR. MIMS: A utility, but a fun utility, right? MS. EVANS: Well, yeah, I guess a fun utility, because at the beginning, I think it’ll be kind of cool. But 100 years from now, it’ll just be like, “Yeah, of course, there’s a machine that takes you from point A to point B. And that’s that.” Write to Christopher Mims at christopher.mims@wsj.com ",https://www.wsj.com/articles/reimagining-the-car-and-carbon-removal-11571958000,Medium,1,Yes,0
17,"Oxfam America took the unusual step Tuesday of criticizing the U.S. government for its “slow and inadequate” response to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, saying that the Trump administration's faltering relief efforts has forced it to intervene.
The announcement by the U.S. branch of the global anti-poverty nonprofit organization comes as President Trump visited the U.S. territory for the first time since Hurricane Maria slammed into the island of 3.4 million people almost two weeks ago, setting off a humanitarian crisis.
“Oxfam has monitored the response in Puerto Rico closely, and we are outraged at the slow and inadequate response the US Government has mounted in Puerto Rico,” Abby Maxman, president of Oxfam America, said in a statement.
“We’re hearing excuses and criticism from the administration instead of a cohesive and compassionate response,” she added.

Oxfam America said it will pursue its own two-pronged approach in the post-hurricane response: pushing for an improved response to the crisis, and supporting local partners that are providing relief on the ground.
In Puerto Rico, many families are running out of food and water, roads remain destroyed, and less than 7 percent of electricity customers currently have power as of Oct. 3, according to a government website.
Trump defies critics of his Puerto Rico response by conducting business as usual
The Federal Emergency Management Agency reports that it has been conducting 24-hour operations to deliver food, water and medicine, and to restore power and infrastructure across the island.
Trump has described the recovery process in Puerto Rico as “incredible.” But he has also criticized Puerto Ricans for not doing enough to help themselves, and chided the island territory for throwing the nation's budget “out of whack.”
During his visit to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, President Trump says, “I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you’ve thrown our budget a little out of whack.” (Video: Reuters)
In response to an email inquiry, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders referred The Post to comments made by Puerto Rico governor Ricardo Rosselló on Saturday, when he said that the administration ""has answered and has complied with our petitions in an expedited manner.""

Scott Paul, senior humanitarian policy adviser for Oxfam America, said the lack of political leadership from the Trump administration prompted the group to issue its direct criticism.
“It's an unusual decision for us,” Paul told The Washington Post. “Generally speaking, in wealthy and even in middle-income countries, Oxfam doesn't ordinarily respond to natural hazards, because it assumes that the most effective response is led by the national government in partnership with local organizations and civil society.
“In this response so far, we know that there is money available if we ask for it, because this country is blessed with an enormous wealth. . . . What we haven't seen is the political leadership to leverage that,” he added.
Paul faulted the administration for waiting six days before it held high-level meetings on the crisis, and for its hesitation on lifting the Jones Act, a 1920 shipping law that requires that ships traveling between two U.S. ports be U.S.-flagged vessels.
Puerto Rico is keeping track of just how slowly its infrastructure is being rebuilt
“Even to this day, we haven't seen the president use the full range of his capacities” in facilitating the necessary hurricane relief work in Puerto Rico, Paul said.

On Tuesday, during his first visit to Puerto Rico since the storm hit the island, President Trump congratulated his administration's “great job” and “A-plus” response to the hurricane in Texas and Florida, telling Puerto Rican officials that they should feel “very proud” they haven’t lost hundreds of lives like in “a real catastrophe like Katrina.” Thirty-four people have died since the storm struck, Puerto Rico's governor announced Tuesday evening.
In the run-up to his visit, Trump has repeatedly attacked San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz on Twitter for her “poor leadership” and for conspiring with Democrats to “be nasty” to his administration. Trump took direct aim at Cruz after she criticized the federal response to the hurricane as having “collapsed,” saying that “we are dying, and you are killing us with the inefficiency and the bureaucracy.”
Trapped in the mountains, Puerto Ricans don’t see help, or a way out
In another tweet, Trump accused “politically motivated ingrates” of failing to praise the administration's response, and cast as fake news stories that criticized his government's work.

This is not the first time Oxfam has explicitly criticized Trump.
Earlier last month, Oxfam protested the Trump administration's proposed reduction of the refugee quota by renting out and hosting refugees at the Queens, N.Y., house where Trump grew up.
And for Mother's Day in May, Oxfam America's climate change and energy director wrote an open letter to Ivanka Trump asking her to “be the voice of reason and urge your father to keep the U.S. in the Paris agreement.”

18,"There are plenty of reasons you may wish you lived in California — beautiful weather, beautiful people, that 7-Eleven that sold a winning Powerball ticket.
But you only need one reason not to:
Be grateful, anyone who lives anywhere else.
As for you Californians — well, we’re keeping you in our thoughts.
For the third time in recent months, a rare venomous, yellow-bellied sea snake has washed up on the Golden State’s shores, freaking out beach-goers and intriguing biologists. These creatures typically dwell in tropical waters and never come ashore. What were they doing, cold and covered in sand, in California?
The explanation, like so many of California’s other woes, is tied to the weather.
“Because the water is so warm here now, these snakes can swim, hunt and reproduce just like they could in the northern part of their tropical range,” Paul Barber, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCLA, told the Huffington Post after the first snake was found in October. “Simply put, they are here because the warmer El Niño conditions have expanded the range of suitable environmental conditions for this snake.”

Yellow-bellied sea snakes are typically black and yellow with a broad, paddle-like tail. They can grow to the length of a baseball bat and are potentially lethal. Their venom contains a potent neurotoxin that stops muscles from communicating with nerve cells, and a single bite can cause respiratory, heart or nerve failure, according to the University of Hawaii’s Waikiki Aquarium.
Luckily, these serpents don’t usually pose too much of a threat to humans because they spend most of their times in the warm, tropical waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. They rarely swim close to shore and never come onto dry land voluntarily — their tapered bellies prevent them from slithering.
[Animals are showing up in really strange places – this is the surprising reason why]
The snakes aren’t the only animals turning up in surprising places (they’ve also been seen in Australia). In 2010, a lone gray whale — a species that had never been seen outside the Pacific Ocean — was spotted off the Mediterranean coast of Israel. Last summer, a Florida manatee paddled its way up into a Delaware canal. And a sub-Antarctic fur seal was discovered off the coast of Kenya, more than 100 miles farther north than the species had ever been seen before.

Isolated incidents can be chalked up to curious animals wandering too far afield of their ordinary homes. But many researchers believe that something bigger is going on. Recent chaotic climate conditions have scrambled the ecosystems of countless marine species. The oceans are warmer, thanks to climate change and the Pacific’s strange “warm blob,” and the weather is wackier because of an unusually powerful El Niño.
“If you put a bunch of species in a blender, you’re not entirely sure what’s going to come out,” said Malin L. Pinsky, a marine biologist at Rutgers University, told the New York Times last fall.
In August, the journal Nature Climate Change published an ambitious study analyzing the current ranges of nearly 13,000 species of marine animals to figure out where they might wind up in a climate change scenario. It turned out that a few yellow-bellied sea snakes in California are among the least strange things scientists can expect.

Sea creatures will move away from the increasingly warm waters in the tropics — endangering the way of life for fishing-dependent communities — and toward the poles, where they’ll encounter other creatures, both predator and prey. Some newly arrived species will flourish, others will probably go extinct.
“It’s a game about winners and losers, I think,” Jorge García Molinos, the lead author of the study, told the Times.
For now, those scenarios remain mostly theoretical. The presence of a highly venomous snake on a beach near San Diego, on the other hand, is all too real.
Still, herpetologists — snake experts — say there’s not too much cause for alarm.
“Their fangs are tiny and they can barely open their mouths wide enough to bite a person,” Greg Pauly, herpetological curator at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, told the Los Angeles Times. “So, unless you pick one up, the biggest safety concern with going to the beach is with driving there and then driving home.”

19," Fracking has turned Pennsylvania into the nation’s second-largest producer of natural gas, making energy a jobs issue that could hinder Joe Biden’s path to the White House—with the choice of fracking-foe Kamala Harris as running mate adding yet another potential hurdle. President Trump carried the state in 2016 by less than 1 percent of the vote, making it a prime target for Democrats to recapture this year with the Pennsylvania-born Mr. Biden atop the ticket. But Democrats there tread carefully on energy policy, and Mr. Biden has been pushing the bounds of what Pennsylvania voters may accept. He supports a partial ban on fracking—only on federal lands—and has said he would put the weight of the federal government behind a push away from fossil fuels. Now, he is adding a partner to the ticket, Ms. Harris, who goes further, fully supporting the progressive Green New Deal and a ban on fracking everywhere. Alan Benyak, a Democratic State Committee member in Southwestern Pennsylvania, said adding Ms. Harris to the ticket would help his party win votes in Philadelphia and the state’s populous eastern region, where Black turnout was depressed in 2016. But Ms. Harris won’t be much of an asset in his corner of the state, a hotbed for gas, coal and electricity companies, he said. “I think she’s a great choice for him nationally, and I think she’ll help him in Pennsylvania, certainly in Philadelphia,’’ said Mr. Benyak, a lawyer in Charleroi, Pa. “But in the collar counties around Pittsburgh, not much.’’ The battle for Pennsylvania may well turn on Southwestern Pennsylvania—and potentially on energy policy. While Democrats traditionally build large margins in Philadelphia, and are increasingly strong in its suburbs, Mr. Trump in 2016 ran up the score in working-class counties, including those in Southwestern Pennsylvania, outside Pittsburgh. Vice presidential nominees traditionally defer to the top of the ticket on policy. Already, the policy pages of Ms. Harris’s presidential-campaign website direct readers to Mr. Biden’s campaign. The Biden campaign said Friday that Mr. Biden’s position on fracking remained unchanged. Larry Maggi, a Democratic county commissioner in Washington County, said that Ms. Harris wouldn’t alter the party’s tough challenge in Southwestern Pennsylvania. “It’s already going to be difficult for a Biden-Harris ticket to win this area, just because of their positions before on energy and, of course, Republicans have been able to paint Democrats as anti-Second Amendment,’’ Mr. Maggi said. “I think the mold is set here. Either you’re for Biden, or you’re for Trump.’’ The decline of the steel and coal industries has hurt those counties for decades. The fracking boom that took hold around 2008 blunted the loss of coal and boosted other businesses—hotels, restaurants and car dealerships—serving an influx of new workers. Many people living in the area drew new income from leasing and royalties from gas drilling on their property. Republicans, touting deregulation and supporting fossil fuels, began drawing more support across this part of the state. Mr. Trump became the first Republican nominee to win Pennsylvania since 1988. In Westmoreland County, outside Pittsburgh, Mr. Trump won 64% support in 2016 and a surplus of nearly 57,000 votes—More than his statewide margin of 44,000 votes. In nearby Washington County, where the region’s fracking boom began, Mr. Trump won 60% of the vote and a margin of 25,000 votes. Democrats say Mr. Trump likely will win those counties again, but that Mr. Biden’s working-class roots can help him eat into the big vote margins the president relied on to carry the state. Republicans say Mr. Trump is as popular as ever. “If Biden could lower those margins—and I don’t believe he will—Kamala Harris washes that away,’’ said Luke Berardelli, a local school board member and former chairman of the Beaver County Young Republicans, outside Pittsburgh. An important reason, he said, is Ms. Harris’s statement on fracking, “which is going to resonate here in Western Pennsylvania,’’ he said. “There’s no doubt about that.’’ As a presidential candidate, Ms. Harris said at a CNN forum last year that “there’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking’’—a clip the Trump campaign worked into its digital ads this week. Environmental groups want Ms. Harris to bring Mr. Biden along toward her position. “We’re hopeful that her selection means that a Biden administration will take a stronger position on fracking and on fossil fuels in general than he seems inclined to do on his own,’’ said Mitch Jones, policy director for Food & Water Action, an advocacy group. That remains to be seen. Despite Ms. Harris’s tough anti-fracking stand at the CNN forum, the climate plan she released as a presidential candidate didn’t include such a ban, just more disclosure of the chemicals used in fracking. The Trump campaign and its allies already have been running ads in the state asserting that Mr. Biden would place a “ban on fracking.’’ Mr. Trump dug into the issue soon after the announcement of Ms. Harris’s selection. “How do you think ‘no fracking’ in Pennsylvania is going to play?” Mr. Trump said from the White House press room. “That’s a big fracking state. If you didn’t have energy produced that way…you’d have unemployment that you wouldn’t believe.” Polling finds highly divided opinions on fracking in Pennsylvania. Do you think fracking should be banned in the U.S.? Why or why not? Join the conversation below. In a CBS/YouGov survey this month, 52% said they opposed it, while 48% said they supported it. Views were divided sharply by party, with Democrats opposed and Republicans supportive. At the same time, slightly more voters said Mr. Trump would do a better job of handling fracking and gas exploration than would Mr. Biden, 45% to 42%. That half the state still opposes fracking suggests that Mr. Biden’s path to victory there may be similar to that in other states, even if it is more challenging. Pushing leftward has been part of a concerted effort to build momentum with young liberals who place a priority on policies to rein in climate change. There are many such voters in Eastern Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh’s urban core. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll from January found 23% of voters ages 18 to 34 said they were voting solely based on climate issues, the most of any age group.

20," LONDON—U.K. Treasury chief Rishi Sunak on Monday outlined a review of finance rules, including possible changes to make it easier for companies to raise money in London, aimed at keeping the country’s vast financial sector competitive with New York after Brexit. Over the past two decades, London cemented its position as a global financial-services launchpad in part because, once given a license by U.K. authorities, its banks, insurers and clearinghouses got automatic regulatory clearance to sell to clients across the European Union’s other members. Brexit is ending that. On Jan.1, the U.K. officially will no longer be part of the EU’s single market or its zone of common financial regulation. Financial companies have already moved billions of dollars in assets and hundreds of staff into the EU to prepare for this dislocation. Mr. Sunak laid out measures and reviews on Monday that he said can ensure London’s financial sector continues to rival hubs in New York and Singapore. “We are starting a new chapter in the history of financial services and renewing the U.K.’s position as the world’s pre-eminent financial center,” said Mr. Sunak. The plan includes making the U.K. a leader in green finance and a series of reviews to ensure its financial sector is efficiently regulated. The U.K. chancellor announced a task force that will be charged with refreshing U.K. securities-listing rules to make it easier to raise money in London. Mr. Sunak said that as the U.K. moves away from the EU it is already tightening regulatory ties with other financial centers in Switzerland, Japan and India to try to boost cross-border financial trade. Currently almost 40% of the U.K.’s trade in financial services is with the EU and some of that will be lost after Brexit, New Financial, a London-based research organization, said last month. Initial hopes among bankers in London for continued frictionless access to the EU’s financial market after Brexit have ended. The U.K. left the EU on Jan. 31 and entered a transition period in which economic and financial relations stayed the same. Trade talks to set economic relations after Jan. 1 between the U.K. and EU are bogged down and a wide-ranging deal to include financial services isn’t under negotiation. Britain’s government is adamant that one of the main prizes after Brexit is the right to diverge from EU rules. The Bank of England has said it must have control over financial regulation after Brexit. The EU, meanwhile, sees Brexit as a once-in-a-generation chance to pry financial-sector jobs and expertise away from the U.K. Some U.K.-based investment banking businesses can potentially still get access to certain EU markets on the basis of so-called “equivalence,” a unilateral decision that is in the hands of the Brussels-based European Commission. So far, the EU has granted equivalence for clearing of euro-denominated derivatives only for 18 months, aiming to spare any market dislocation when Brexit takes place Jan.1. Other equivalence decisions are pending. Hoping to encourage the EU to declare its hand, the U.K. Treasury on Monday published a series of its own equivalence decisions relating to firms based in the EU. They include recognizing that derivatives traded on EU exchanges would be classified by the U.K. as exchange-traded rather than over-the-counter, and therefore attract lower capital requirements. The Treasury said publishing its own equivalence decisions delivered “on its commitment to be open, predictable and transparent, even in the absence of clarity from the EU on their approach.” Even if equivalence is granted by Brussels, bankers fret that the EU could revoke it with just 30 days’ notice. To mitigate this, companies including JP Morgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and American International Group Inc. have set up offices across the continent to ensure they can service European clients. Meanwhile, the U.K. government wants to bolster London’s status as a global financial center by making it a leader in providing money to tackle climate change, announcing it would launch its first government bond next year to finance green infrastructure. At a conference Monday, Bank of England Gov. Andrew Bailey compared the scale of changes needed to the Bretton Woods agreement of 1944, which created the immediate postwar currency system and the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. “Compared with the financial crisis and the pandemic, the risks from climate change are even bigger and more complex to manage,” Mr. Bailey said. “Acting now gives us the best opportunity to manage those risks.” Write to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com and Simon Clark at simon.clark@wsj.com ",https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-sets-plan-to-keep-up-with-new-york-as-financial-center-after-brexit-11604952230,Medium,1,Yes,0
21," Some readers thought we exaggerated when we reported on California’s plan to ban the sale of gas-powered cars by 2035. Well, now there’s a bill in Congress promising the same for everyone in America. Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley and four other Democrats introduced legislation Tuesday that would mandate 100% of cars sold in 2035 be electric and 50% of new cars by 2025—a Biden Presidency from now. Last year a mere 2% of car sales were electric, notwithstanding the $7,500 federal tax credit, state subsidies and other incentives such as car-pool lane access. Kamala Harris declined to put her name on the bill, though the climate change plan she proposed last year also banned the sale of gas-powered cars by 2035. Progressives have been hyping electrics for years, and that’s fine if consumers want to buy them. But EVs haven’t caught on with consumers because they’re expensive and most can’t travel farther than 250 miles without a multi-hour recharge. Automakers say batteries are improving and becoming less expensive, but they are still out of price range for 99% of Americans. GM on Tuesday drew oohs and aahs when it unveiled an electric Hummer with a 350-mile range and other spiffy features. The price tag: $112,595. Folks in middle America can buy a home for less. No matter. Democrats now want to compel Americans to buy cars they can’t afford or don’t want by banning the sale of internal-combustion engines. Major automakers such as Ford, Volkswagen and Fiat Chrysler that can’t sell enough EVs are already scrambling to meet Europe’s auto emissions standards by paying Tesla and Chinese electric manufacturers for regulatory credits. The Democratic bill would add to this regulatory jam, which explains why investors are pouring into electric-car startups with no track record such as Nikola, Hyliion, Fisker and Lordstown. This isn’t a vote of confidence in EVs. It’s a bet that large automakers won’t meet government mandates and will then have to pay niche players for credits. Tesla first modelled this financial engineering. To recap: Bribing Americans to buy electric cars hasn’t worked, so now Democrats plan to use government coercion to force them. Wall Street whizzes will make a nice buck while other Americans pay up. ",https://www.wsj.com/articles/target-your-gas-car-11603316118,Medium,1,Yes,0
22,"The California utility that owns a pair of nuclear power reactors at Diablo Canyon said in an agreement with environmental groups that it will close the plants when their licenses expire in the middle of the next decade instead of applying for license renewals.
The closing of the two reactors will leave California without any nuclear power plants after April 2025. The utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, said it would replace the nuclear power generated there with renewable-energy projects and energy-efficiency initiatives.
The decision ends a ­long-running battle over the fate of the Diablo Canyon reactors, located near major geological fault lines close to the California coast about halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco. The twin 1,100-megawatt reactors produce about 9 percent of the state’s electricity.
Several leading climate scientists have supported extending the licenses because the power is generated without greenhouse gas emissions, but environmental groups have said the location of the reactors puts hundreds of thousands of Californians in danger in case of an accident or an earthquake.
“This is an historic agreement,” Erich Pica, president of Friends of the Earth, said in a statement. “It sets a date for the certain end of nuclear power in California and assures replacement with clean, safe, cost-competitive, renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy storage. It lays out an effective roadmap for a nuclear phase-out in the world’s sixth-largest economy, while assuring a green energy replacement plan to make California a global leader in fighting climate change.”
The Diablo Canyon reactors are the latest nuclear power plants to be closed as a combination of cheap natural gas and new ­renewable-energy projects makes competition difficult. Four reactors were shut down in 2013 — including the San Onofre nuclear power station near Los Angeles — and one was taken offline in 2014. Meanwhile, a plant opened this year in Tennessee, and four more are under construction elsewhere. The current total of operating reactors in the United States is 100.
However, many reactors, most about four decades old, are coming to the end of their licenses, and companies are weighing returns on renewable-energy projects against the cost of making improvements to nuclear plants to persuade the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to grant long-term extensions.
That worries supporters of nuclear power. “While solar and wind have grown significantly, they have not grown enough to make up for lost nuclear,” said Michael Shellenberger, founder of the pro-nuclear group Environmental Progress.
California’s renewable portfolio standard requires that by 2030, utilities get 50 percent of their electricity from renewable sources — without counting nuclear power. PG&E said it would hit a 55 percent renewable target by 2031.
“California’s energy landscape is changing dramatically with energy efficiency, renewables and storage being central to the state’s energy policy,” PG&E chief executive Tony Earley said in a statement. “As we make this transition, Diablo Canyon’s full output will no longer be required.”
Geisha Williams, PG&E’s president for electricity, said in a conference call that the company concluded that ratepayers would not pay more for new renewable sources of energy than they would have paid to keep Diablo Canyon open. But she said that calculation took as a given the state’s renewable portfolio standard, which mandates sharp increases in ­renewable-energy use and might have forced the reactors to run at as little as half their capacity.
PG&E also faced other regulatory hurdles to renew the nuclear permits. The California State Lands Commission will meet June 28, and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and two other members could seek to deny a critical permit for Diablo Canyon.
Other parties to the agreement include Friends of the Earth, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1245, the Coalition of California Utility Employees, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Environment California and the Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility.
PG&E said it will spend $350 million to help keep a skilled workforce in place while the plant is functioning. The company will also pay the local county, San Luis Obispo, $50 million.
The closing of Diablo Canyon has historical significance in the environmental movement. In 1969, David Brower quit his position as executive director of the Sierra Club after 17 years following a dispute with other club leaders over whether to oppose the construction of the reactors. Brower, who died in 2000, then founded two new groups, Friends of the Earth and the John Muir Institute for Environmental Studies. He later reconciled with the Sierra Club.
Elsewhere in the utility industry, many companies are sticking with nuclear power. Duke Energy chief executive Lynn Good said, “We love the nuclear plants that we operate.” Good said the utility’s 11 reactors help keep its carbon emissions down and its electricity rates 20 to 30 percent below the national average. She said Duke Energy is seeking extensions of its licenses so it can “continue operating these plants as far as we can.”
But the NRDC’s energy coordinator, Ralph Cavanagh, said renewable resources and improved storage devices are more flexible than nuclear power, which is designed to deliver steady base-load power and not to be ramped up or down. He said phasing out Diablo Canyon will give PG&E time to develop more renewable-energy sources rather than forcing the utility to turn to more readily available natural gas as a substitute.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/california-utility-to-close-diablo-canyon-nuclear-power-reactors-by-2025/2016/06/21/8fd13b62-37af-11e6-8f7c-d4c723a2becb_story.html,Medium,1,Yes,0
23,"As the House impeachment managers were chronicling President Trump’s self-involved corruption, a group of mayors made another convincing case against Trump — without ever mentioning his name.
Trump rose to power by promising to “drain the swamp” and take on a Washington out of touch with the concerns of Americans and the challenges facing their communities.
He has broken both promises. His blatant corruption is part of a larger politics of spectacle that has nothing to do with fixing things or making life at least a bit better in our nation’s neighborhoods.
Many complain about polarization and a politics mired in ideology. In fact, Trump survives by making polarization worse. Ideology and cultural warfare allow him to survive while avoiding talk about policies and problems that don’t interest him in the least.

It was thus refreshing to sit down last week with a group of mayors who can’t hide behind rants about building walls or fighting “hoaxes.”
Follow E.J. Dionne Jr.'s opinions
The five chief executives I spoke with are part of a group called NewDEAL, a network of local officials who swap ideas about how to make their cities grow economically in sustainable ways. I asked them — all Democrats from bluish cities in states that backed Trump — not about the president but about what they wished national politicians were focused on.
Their answers were instructive, starting with climate change and its impact on coastal cities and the interior heartland alike. They stressed how little help they are getting to repair their local infrastructure, which is underfinanced because city budgets are heavily committed to core local responsibilities, particularly public safety.

They talked about the housing crisis, better schools, broadband access and a wish for greater federal commitment to local economic development plans.
“There is a certain type of person who lives for solving problems, [who] just likes to check stuff off a list and get stuff done that they think is important to get done, and that is what city government is all about,” said Mayor Eric Johnson of Dallas. “It’s not about the stuff that I think fills up the news cycle, the social stuff.
“Being mayor,” he continued, “is about delivering water service and making sure you have parks for your families to play in. It’s very practical stuff, it’s very important stuff.” Voters “have gotten so tired of Washington not really doing a whole lot.”
Climate change was at the top of Mayor Rick Kriseman’s list because his city of St. Petersburg, Fla., is “a peninsula on a peninsula . . . one of the most at-risk cities and regions in the country, and in the world.” His questions: “How do we adapt to the rising seas we are already seeing, and what do we do going forward?”

It’s hard to get farther from the coast than Lincoln, Neb., but the city’s mayor, Leirion Gaylor Baird, agreed with Kriseman. “We don’t have time to debate the causes of severe weather or man-made climate change effects that are causing historic floods across the state of Nebraska and impacting the well fields that my city depends on for our water supply,” she said. “We really need to partner with the federal government to fix our well fields, to address our levies, to build more resilient communities.”
Climate also mattered to Mayor Lauren McLean of Boise, Idaho, but she highlighted housing affordability.
“We need help with the housing trust fund to make it possible to address housing for those that are unhoused,” McLean said. “We need help with funding and policy innovation to address homelessness in different ways, to care for them, to connect [them to] services, to move them into a shelter and into a home.”

And from Montgomery, Ala., Mayor Steven Reed said his city had “a lot of ideas, a lot of initiatives” to spur economic growth, “but not a lot of support.”
“When you’re not in a growth center, then you need probably more federal support than maybe some of the larger cities might need,” Reed said, urging an expansion of the Community Development Block Grant program and infrastructure investment that includes “fiber,” high-speed Internet for the places that lack it.
The many other practical things these mayors had to say offered hope for our country in the long run. But they also inspired a longing.
As Trump’s lawyers made their case against impeachment on Saturday with a mixture of bombast, half-truth and outright falsehood, I was struck that there was one assertion by Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) that they would never challenge. Schiff had observed that you could always trust the president to “do what’s right for Donald Trump.” Wouldn’t it be nice to have a president who cared about our problems, and not just himself?

24," Trees, although they seem immutably rooted, are resourcefully shifty. Like all other living things, they are capable of movement from one place to another in search of better nourishment or safety. That’s the salient and perhaps surprising takeaway from science reporter Zach St. George’s “The Journeys of Trees,” a deeply researched book that is liable to change your perspective on the magnificent, tall, woody creatures that cover one-third of the Earth’s land. Of course, trees are not exactly light on their feet. They move at an infinitesimal, glacial pace. “The migration of a forest is just many trees sprouting in the same direction,” Mr. St. George writes. Scientists call this sort of movement dispersal, and track the progress of trees over eons through the study of fossils that ancient forests have left behind. They have learned, for example, that fast-growing metasequoias lived in the Arctic during the temperate mid-Miocene era about 10 million years ago, when Alaska was as warm as New Jersey. That changed in the Pliocene and Pleistocene eras, as vast sheets of ice covered large parts of the world. Asa Gray, a prominent 19th-century American botanist, conjectured that plants were pushed to lower latitudes as the cold advanced, and later pushed northward again as the ice retreated. Among the species that moved south were the sequoias, which put down roots in the Sierra Nevada range. By Zach St. George
Norton, 244 pages, $26.95 The hopeful message here is that the ability to relocate, which has enabled various tree species, including sequoias, to survive in the past, may help save them now as our planet heats up at an unprecedented rate. But because of the rapidity of climate change due to carbon emissions, trees may not be able to move fast enough on their own to save themselves. This has led to questions about whether—and how—people should assist in their migration. “The Journeys of Trees” focuses primarily on two kinds of trees that currently find themselves stuck in places that are very different from when each species sprouted: Florida torreyas, which are beleaguered by fungi in Florida’s increasingly steamy climate, and the giant sequoias in the Sierra Nevada, which are increasingly parched and threatened by wildfires. In order to figure out what to do about such issues, biogeographers consider fundamental questions such as why specific species of trees “live where they do and not where they do not.” Even when it is determined that a species would be better off moved to cooler zones, foresters’ overarching concern is to proceed with caution, so that saving one species won’t endanger others. Mr. St. George modestly warns us that he is “just a writer, not a scientist or a forester or an activist.” What he brings to this book, his first, is a flair for gathering and distilling often esoteric scientific findings into lively, accessible explanations. He takes a good hard look at both the forest and the trees—from above, below, afar, up close, within and without, as he explores their history and uncertain future. An avid reporter, Mr. St. George interviews scores of scientific specialists on the frontlines of conservation—plant pathologists, invasion biologists, entomologists, forest ecologists, and even a limnologist (a scientist who studies lakes). He considers the pluses and minuses of periodic controlled fires, and discusses the sometimes inadvertent repercussions of introducing new species into new territories. He tracks down a woman so obsessed with her mission to save the Florida torreya and other conifers that she has eaten their seeds in order to better disperse them in digested form. He also treks through forests in Florida, California, Michigan, Canada, New Zealand, and Alaska, where he grew up. He visits the entomology department of the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., to learn more about invasive insects such as the emerald ash borer, a stowaway in shipping pallets from abroad that is decimating American ash trees. At a botanical garden in Georgia, he checks out an experimental thicket of transported Florida torreyas. He speaks with forest managers in Quebec grappling with rising rates of wildfires, and visits a local tree nursery that grows seedlings to replace some of the losses. One of his more intrepid adventures involves learning how to climb giant sequoias and harvest their cones for seeds for the Sierra Pacific company’s Giant Sequoia Genetic Conservation replanting project, which he hails as “a textbook example of assisted migration.” Through all this, Mr. St. George never loses sight of what trees mean to people. He reminds us that they provide fuel, building materials, fruit, shade, oxygen, paper, erosion control, and carbon storage. He also reminds us that they take years and years to mature. If not felled by loggers, razed by forest fires, or blighted by invasive insects or diseases, many live for centuries. Plant a tree, Mr. St. George writes movingly, “and you have extended a hand to the future.” “The Journeys of Trees” isn’t always a joyride. Although only 200 pages, it is somewhat repetitious. Occasionally, there is simply more information than a general reader might wish to know. What will keep you reading is Mr. St. George’s writing. He has a way with metaphors. He describes the spruce forests growing where sequoia once stood along Alaska’s southern coast as “a scratchy sweater draped across the shoulders of the continent,” and notes later that “this great boreal sweater had begun to unravel.” There are some wonderful stories tucked in among the book’s branches. A chapter on invasive insects, amusingly titled, “Kiss Your Ash Good-Bye,” begins with the tale of a Frenchman living in Medford, Mass., in the late 1860s who hoped to start an American silk industry. One of the caterpillars he was experimenting with escaped. It was the European gypsy moth. Oops. Or, as Mr. St. George writes, “Merde.” Another delightful bit of history involves a hapless 19th-century Scottish explorer and naturalist named David Douglas, who introduced hundreds of species to the British Isles. His misadventures on multiple plant-gathering expeditions to North America—braving extreme heat, cold, and numerous watery disasters—read like farce. No joke, though: At age 35, he was found dead at the bottom of a pit used to trap wild cattle near Mauna Kea. His posthumous consolation: Douglas firs were named in his honor. If you can get past its plodding title, you’ll learn a lot from “The Journeys of Trees.” (Unfortunately, “The Overstory” was already taken by Richard Powers for his superb 2018 novel about trees.) One small example: Allergy sufferers may be dismayed to learn that “pollen is nearly indestructible.” But, recovered in plugs of ancient peat moss, this yellow fertilizing powder holds a key to the history of Holocene forests. In a particularly lovely passage, Mr. St. George describes seeing, with the help of a dendrometer, trees breathe. “For me, this was a new view,” he writes. “I’d thought about trees in various ways: as features of the landscape; as systems of pipes and solar arrays and chemical converters; as records of years and even millennia past; as habitat for other species; as sources of raw materials . . . At that moment, though, looking at the pumping heart of a balsam fir, I could see that it was alive in a way unexpectedly similar to the way I was.” All the more reason to help these beloved wonders of the plant world on their stately, inspiring journeys. —Ms. McAlpin reviews books regularly for the Journal, NPR.org, the Christian Science Monitor and the Los Angeles Times.

25,"Methane is bubbling up out of the Condamine River in Queensland, Australia, and Jeremy Buckingham wants you to know what he thinks about it. To make his point perfectly clear, he lights the river on fire in this video posted to his Facebook page.
“Sometimes a picture says a thousand words,” says Buckingham, a member of parliament representing the New South Wales Greens party. “The fracking is just a kilometer away, methane coming up and now the river is alight.”
The Condamine River has been seeping methane for years, but no one is really sure why. Buckingham is convinced it’s because of hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” in the area.
Origin Energy operates coal seam gas wells in the region, but the company says it doesn’t think it’s to blame for the leaks. After a 2012 report, the company said that an “investigation into the seeps found no evidence of safety risk or environmental harm.”

However, we do know that methane does harm the environment by contributing to global warming. Methane is 25 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide over a period of 100 years. Methane leaks like this one can and do occur naturally, particularly when frozen organic material melts — something that’s currently happening in Arctic permafrost. It’s an area that researchers are striving to understand.
There are also plenty of leaks that are human-caused. A 2014 report on methane “leaks” that inevitably accompany natural gas production totally negate the climate change benefit of using natural gas as a low-emission source of energy. And earlier this month, the EPA reported that the U.S. energy industry is emitting far more methane than previously thought. “The oil and gas sector is the largest emitting-sector for methane and accounts for a third of total U.S. methane emissions,” the agency said.
Meanwhile in Australia, Buckingham hopes the strong visual will persuade people to stop backing the fracking industry. “The most incredible thing I’ve ever seen — a tragedy in the Murray-Darling basin,” says Buckingham. “This is utterly unacceptable.”

26,"MONACA, Pa. — The hulking petrochemical plant is being constructed 30 miles from his city, but Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto worries it's just the sort of polluting industry that could threaten residents' health and drive away the white-collar jobs of the future.
""If there is one city in the United States that should have learned from the mistakes that it made in the previous industrial revolution, it's Pittsburgh,"" Peduto (D) said.
But here near the developing complex on the banks of the Ohio River, local Democratic official Earl “Butch” Shamp looks downstream at Peduto and sees the kind of politician he says is killing the Democratic Party in large swaths of southwestern Pennsylvania.
“When people here hear the mayor, they hear someone who’s just totally out of touch about where the jobs are,” said Shamp, the lone Democrat on the Potter Township Board of Supervisors in Beaver County, where the plant is located. “The mayor should just stay out of it and stay in Pittsburgh.”

Royal Dutch Shell’s giant petrochemical facility, which will “crack” natural gas molecules to produce a component for plastics, is also exposing a crack in Pennsylvania’s Democratic Party. For some, like Peduto, the project is an environmental menace that undercuts the party’s climate change agenda.
For others, like Shamp, it is a catalyst for a region’s economic revival and an opportunity to win over a white working class that believes Democrats have prioritized social issues over their financial prosperity.
With Pennsylvania expected to be a crucial battleground in the 2020 presidential contest, the local fissure is highlighting a national dilemma for the Democratic Party as it tries to address the environmental demands of liberal urban activists while reaching out to voters who rely on the manufacturing industry for jobs.
The party’s failure to find that balance proved fateful in 2016, when blue-collar voters in the counties that surround Pittsburgh abandoned Democrats in droves, and Donald Trump carried the state by about 44,000 votes.

“In Pennsylvania, everything matters right now” politically, said Christopher P. Borick, the director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion. “This is certainly not where Democrats want to be, in terms of finding a unified voice in a key swing state ahead of 2020.”
The petrochemical plant has become a political crucible. President Trump visited the Shell site in August, speaking for more than an hour while surrounded by construction workers and touting the complex as “one of the single biggest construction projects in the nation . . . made possible by clean, affordable, all-American natural gas.”
Trump’s speech at a Shell plant drew thousands of workers. They were paid overtime to be there.
For Trump’s political rivals, Peduto has upped the ante by tying his potential endorsement to where the candidates stand on environmental matters. He has reached out to the campaigns of former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, hoping that they back his vision for more government funding for green industries.
Peduto said he is leaning toward Bloomberg and Buttigieg because the energy policy positions of Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — who support a ban on fracking — “would be devastating to the Rust Belt.” Conversely, Biden’s positions, he said, “are more like Donald Trump’s than they are a pragmatic approach toward the middle.”
Shell’s 400-acre facility relies on Pennsylvania’s vast reserves of natural gas, obtained by fracking shaleto produce ethylene, a component of plastic that is used for various consumer products, from food containers to furniture.

Its construction has generated 6,000 jobs already, and it is slated to employ 600 permanent workers when it opens in the “early 2020s,” according to the company. Industry leaders and state officials say the area around the plant could turn into a hub for the petrochemical industry, producing more jobs, with tentative discussions about a half-dozen additional petrochemical facilities in nearby communities in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia.
Worried about western Pennsylvania becoming the next “chemical alley,” Peduto shocked many observers in October when he called for a moratorium on cracker plants, against the wishes of corporate and labor leaders.
The Shell plant is licensed to produce up to 1.6 million tons of polyethylene annually, a process that could involve emitting up to 522 tons of volatile organic compounds and 348 tons of nitrogen oxides annually. Peduto said those emissions are equal to adding 450,000 vehicles to ­Pittsburgh-area highways, severely undercutting the city’s goal of being carbon neutral by 2030.

Peduto, who is in his second term, also worries that the plant will make it harder for him to attract and retain the medical and technology jobs that power Pittsburgh’s economy.
“We have to be able to recognize that there is a new industry that has been built out in southwestern Pennsylvania, and it is contingent upon clean air and clean water,” Peduto said, citing Uber’s and Microsoft’s recent investments in the region. “And that industry is much more important than the legacy and industry of fossil fuel.”
The blowback from other Democrats has been intense. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf publicly broke with Peduto on the issue, saying that the region cannot flourish economically without capitalizing on its natural resources, which he thinks can be done in an environmentally responsible way.
“We have to do it right, but we have to do it, or we are not going to have the future that we deserve,” Wolf said in an interview. “I think you need the jobs of technology, which Pittsburgh has, but I think you need to take advantage of your natural attributes, one of which is natural gas.”

Shell said it has taken steps to minimize the complex’s environmental impact.
“We designed our Pennsylvania facility to obtain the lowest achievable emissions. That includes deployment of the best emissions control technologies available and one of the nation’s most stringent leak detection and repair programs,” the company said in an emailed statement.
Some Pennsylvania Democrats regret not voting in 2016. They say they’ll be sure to cast a ballot in 2020.
Peduto’s position is in line with his constituents’ evolving politics. Since Trump’s election, Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh and its immediate suburbs, has moved to the left politically, with Democrats flipping two state Senate seats and one seat on the county council.
Two democratic socialists, Sara Innamorato and Summer Lee, also unseated incumbent Democrats in state legislative races in Allegheny County after they campaigned on environmental issues, including opposition to fracking.

“Citizens are finally saying, ‘We’ve had enough climate change, and we’ve had enough air pollution, and the last thing we want is the region to be inundated with even more bad air,’ ” said Matt Dixon, a Pittsburgh environmental activist.
Despite those recent Democratic gains in Allegheny County, the rest of southwestern Pennsylvania has continued to move to the right. Last year, Republicans seized control of four county boards in historically Democratic areas.
Pennsylvania Republicans predict Peduto’s environmental views will drive even more voters away from Democrats this year.
“This is a guy who put together a $9 billion tax credit plan to try to lure Amazon, but yet he wants to toss these jobs away?” said Allegheny County Councilman Sam DeMarco III (R), referring to Pittsburgh’s unsuccessful effort to lure Amazon’s planned East Coast headquarters. (Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

In Beaver County, Shamp said Democratic residents feel Peduto cares more about “building bike lanes” than workers’ ability to feed their families.
“Democrats have just gone way, way too far to the left,” said Shamp, 61, who voted for Trump in 2016 and probably will again. “I don’t believe in global warming. . . . I believe the Earth goes in cycles, and we just happen to be in a warming cycle right now.”
Residents who live in the river towns near the plant say the local economy has dramatically improved since construction of the plant began in late 2017.
Unemployment has fallen to about 5 percent, approximately half of what it was a decade ago. Residents have seen the construction of several new motels and are eagerly awaiting the opening of a popular Pittsburgh dining staple, Primanti Brothers, which is known for heaping french fries onto thickly sliced sandwiches.

“After all of these years of people talking about the steel mills closing and crying about that, there are now ‘help wanted’ signs everywhere,” said Ed Becker, owner of Bowser’s Restaurant, where customers can get a pound of spaghetti and two meatballs for $6 on Thursdays. “Actually, they have to put ‘help wanted’ banners up — it’s not even a sign anymore.”
In Vanport, a small town that sits across the river from the plant, Margo Collins said her neighbor’s house is on the market for $220,000 — more than double what she bought her similarly sized house for five years ago.
Collins, 54, who described herself as a lifelong Democrat who now supports Trump, said that kind of economic benefit makes it hard to consider the plant’s effect on her health and the environment.
“Of course, it’s going to affect the atmosphere and ozone, but to what degree? Who knows,” Collins said. “We’ve been living with it since the Industrial Revolution, and we’re still here.”

27,"Opinion by the Editorial Board
November 7, 2017
A MAJOR study published last month in the Lancet, a British medical journal, found that there is a global killer responsible for more yearly deaths than AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined: pollution.
The problem is pervasive, affecting every country on the planet. It is expensive, costing the globe a whopping $4.6 trillion a year — about 6 percent of global gross domestic product — in hours not worked, premature deaths, health spending and eroded quality of life. The study associated pollution with 1 in 6 premature deaths, 9 million people in 2015. Even if the numbers are off a bit, the magnitude is striking.
Air pollution is the leading culprit, linked to 6.5 million deaths, followed by water pollution, with 1.8 million. Harmful particulates, toxic chemicals and smog-forming gases result from fuel burning, from primitive dung-fired cooking stoves to massive coal-burning power plants. These and other forms of pollution promote asthma, heart disease, stroke, lung cancer and other maladies. Premature death is only one problem. Long-term impairment before death also results in human misery and material impoverishment.
Developing nations, many of which lack strong environmental enforcement, are much worse off than developed countries, the study found. Poor and middle-income nations account for 92 percent of the premature deaths globally. Pollution drives a full quarter of deaths in some lower-income countries. The study's authors argue that this human toll is not the inevitable price of development, nor a problem that will simply disappear with growth; countries should not ""wait for an economy to reach a magical tipping point that will solve the problems of environmental degradation and pollution-related disease,"" they write.
Instead, the authors insist, developing nations should look to the United States. The creation of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 and the enforcement of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, each passed in the early 1970s and updated since, resulted in dramatic reductions in harmful pollution, over a period of time in which the economy more than doubled in size. Not every pollution restriction that environmentalists dream up makes sense. But mandating relatively cheap pollution controls or, when possible, simply taxing polluters for the damage they do can result in a good value proposition for developing and developed nations alike.
Poor countries struggling to pull their citizens out of abject poverty may yet find it tough to take the long view. Many Americans, including those in the Trump administration, still fail to do so. Conservative critics of environmental rules often overstate the potential costs of pollution controls and discount the benefits. The Trump administration is on this basis weakening pollution rules across the board, sending an early signal about its approach by tapping Scott Pruitt, a climate-change denier, to lead the EPA. Yet the United States has hardly finished the job; the nation still sees tons of pollution pumped into the air, directly harming people and contributing to global warming. Meanwhile, the federal government has not yet addressed other forms of pollution, such as toxic chemical exposure, with needed rigor, and the Trump administration has sent negative signals about its intentions to do so.
The Lancet study should remind leaders in the United States and elsewhere that, though there are costs associated with restricting pollution, countries also incur costs by failing to do so. Finding the right balance requires acknowledging both sides and weighing them carefully.

28," Ruth Gates saw her mission as a race against time to save coral reefs threatened by global warming. As the director of a marine biology institute at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa, her approach was to breed hardier corals more likely to survive climate change. She called it “human-assisted evolution.” “It’s horrible for me to have to say this, but we’ve already lost 50% of the world’s reefs,” she said in a video interview earlier this year. Coral reefs sustain fish and other organisms. Funded partly by a grant from Paul Allen, the Microsoft Corp. co-founder who died recently, Dr. Gates headed a team that has been identifying resilient corals and conditioning them to withstand increasingly warm and acidic water.  Selective breeding, she believed, could create stronger corals to replace those wiped out by pollution and climate change. Her work was highlighted in a 2017 documentary, “Chasing Coral.”  Critics said her strategy could lead to unintended consequences and corals are better left to adapt on their own.  She rejected that criticism in a 2016 interview with the Times Higher Education Supplement: “Realistically, as climate change intensifies, the rates are going to be so fast that there’s no way nature can keep up.” Dr. Gates died Oct. 25. She was 56 and had brain cancer. “Can we take the risk of doing nothing? I would argue we cannot,” she said. “We’d have to be idiots to stand back for the next 10 years and hope for the best.” Her passion and ability to explain her work in simple terms made her a global spokeswoman for her cause. Corals are invertebrate animals with simple stomachs and mouths surrounded by tentacles. They typically form colonies of individual polyps with identical genes. Ruth Deborah Gates was born March 28, 1962, in Cyprus, where her father was working in British military intelligence. She went to boarding school in Kent, England. Inspired by the undersea explorer and documentary maker Jacques Cousteau, she decided by age 11 to become a marine biologist. She earned her doctoral degree in biology at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1990. Her doctoral research involved nearly 1,000 hours of underwater study of corals off Jamaica. Her postdoctoral training was at the University of California, Los Angeles. At the University of Hawaii, her lab was on an island in Kaneohe Bay on the coast of Oahu. She collaborated with scientists at the Australian Institute of Marine Science. Her work didn’t involve genetic modification. “All we’re doing is accelerating or assisting evolution,” she told the Washington Post. Her other interests included karate, in which she had a third-degree black belt. She is survived by her wife, Robin Burton-Gates, a muralist, and a brother, Tim Gates. Write to James R.

Challenge to Clean Power Plan rejected
In a big victory for the Obama administration, a federal court on Thursday rejected a bid by 27 states to block its Clean Power Plan, the centerpiece of its strategy to combat climate change by reducing carbon emissions from power plants.
A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a brief order denying an application seeking to stay the rule while litigation continues.
In October, the states, led by West Virginia, and several major business groups launched the legal challenges seeking to block the administration’s proposal to curb emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants.
More than a dozen other states and the National League of Cities, which represents more than 19,000 U.S. cities, filed court papers backing the Environmental Protection Agency’s rule.
The rule aims to lower carbon emissions from the country’s power plants by 2030 to 32 percent below 2005 levels. It is the main tool for the United States to meet the emissions reduction target it pledged at U.N. climate talks in Paris last month.

The court action means the regulation remains in place, but it is not the final word in the legal fight. The appellate court has to hear oral arguments June 2 and decide whether the regulation is lawful.
West Virginia Attorney General Patrick J. Morrisey (R) said the states will consider asking the Supreme Court to take a “second look” at whether to freeze the regulation.

Officer indicted in unarmed man’s death
An Atlanta area grand jury on Thursday indicted a police officer who fatally shot an unarmed naked man on charges including felony murder, aggravated assault and violating oath of office.
The decision came after DeKalb County prosecutors presented their case against Officer Robert Olsen, who fatally shot Anthony Hill on March 9 while responding to a call of a naked man behaving erratically outside a suburban Atlanta apartment complex.
The family of the 27-year-old Hill says he was a U.S. Air Force veteran who struggled with mental health problems.
DeKalb County District Attorney Robert James said a warrant had been issued for Olsen’s arrest and he expected the officer to be taken into custody Thursday evening.

Olsen was indicted on two counts each of felony murder and violating oath of office and one count each of aggravated assault and making a false statement.
Olsen’s attorney, Don Samuel, said they are disappointed in the grand jury’s decision, but he noted that the defense was not allowed to present any of its witnesses, experts or evidence and also was not allowed to challenge any of the prosecution’s evidence.

Ex-officer gets 263 years for sex assaults
A former Oklahoma City police officer convicted of raping four women and sexually assaulting several others while on duty was sentenced Thursday to 263 consecutive years in prison, the maximum allowable sentence.
In December, an Oklahoma City jury found Daniel Holtzclaw, 29, guilty on 18 of 36 charges of sexual assault, including rape. The sentence was handed down by District Judge Timothy Henderson and came after victims told the court on Thursday that the former officer had destroyed their lives.
Prosecutors said that Holtzclaw preyed on women who had trouble with the law and forced them into sex, hoping their word would not hold up against his in court.
Holtzclaw, who did not testify at his trial, was fired in January 2015 after approximately three years on the job.

Days after Donald Trump took the oath of office, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists reset the Doomsday Clock to 2½ minutes to midnight, in part because of destabilizing comments from America's new commander in chief. One year later, we are moving the clock forward again by 30 seconds, because of the failure of President Trump and other world leaders to deal with looming threats of nuclear war and climate change.
The Science and Security Board for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists assesses that the world is not only more dangerous than it was a year ago; it is as threatening as it has been since World War II. In fact, the Doomsday Clock is as close to midnight today as it was in 1953, when Cold War fears perhaps reached their highest levels.

After Hawaii's false alarm in 2018 about a nuclear attack, were you left wondering what you should do when a nuclear bomb is dropped? You're not alone. (Video: Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)
To call the world nuclear situation dire is to understate the danger — and its immediacy. North Korea's nuclear weapons program appeared to make remarkable progress in 2017, increasing risks for itself, other countries in the region and the United States.
The failure in 2017 to secure a temporary freeze on North Korea's nuclear development was unsurprising to observers of the downward spiral of rhetoric between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. But North Korea's developing nuclear program will reverberate not just in the Asia-Pacific, as neighboring countries review their security options, but also more widely, as all countries consider the costs and benefits of the international framework of nonproliferation treaties and agreements.
Global nuclear risks were compounded by U.S.-Russia relations that now feature more conflict than cooperation. The United States and Russia remained at odds, continuing military exercises along the borders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, undermining the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, upgrading their nuclear arsenals and eschewing arms-control negotiations.

Tensions over the South China Sea have increased. Pakistan and India have continued to build larger arsenals of nuclear weapons. And in the Middle East, uncertainty about continued U.S. support for the landmark Iranian nuclear deal adds to a bleak picture. A related danger is the rise of cyberthreats targeting national infrastructure, including power grids, water supplies and military systems.
On climate change, the danger may seem less immediate than the risk of nuclear annihilation, but avoiding catastrophic temperature increases in the long run requires urgent attention now. Global carbon dioxide emissions have not yet begun the sustained decline toward zero that must occur if we are to avoid ever-greater warming. Nations will have to significantly decrease their greenhouse-gas emissions to manage even the climate risk accepted in the Paris accord. So far, the global response has fallen far short of this challenge.
The Trump administration's decision essentially to turn a blind eye to climate change transpired against a backdrop of a worsening climate, including powerful hurricanes in the Caribbean and other parts of North America and extreme heat in Australia, South America, Asia, Europe and California. The Arctic ice cap achieved its smallest-ever winter maximum in 2017. Last week, data from 2017 demonstrated a continued trend of exceptional global warmth.

We believe that the perilous world security situation described here would, in itself, justify moving the minute hand of the Doomsday Clock closer to midnight. But there also is a real threat posed by a fundamental breakdown in the international order that has been dangerously exacerbated by recent U.S. actions. In 2017, the United States backed away from its long-standing leadership role in the world, reducing its commitment to seek common ground and undermining the overall effort toward solving pressing global governance challenges. Neither allies nor adversaries have been able to reliably predict U.S. actions or discern between sincere U.S. pronouncements and mere rhetoric.
Allies have needed reassurance about American intentions more than ever. Instead, they have been forced to negotiate a thicket of conflicting policy statements from an administration weakened in its cadre of foreign policy professionals and suffering from turnover in senior leadership. Led by an undisciplined and disruptive president, the administration has failed to develop, coordinate and communicate a coherent nuclear policy. This inconsistency constitutes a major challenge for deterrence, alliance management and global stability.
We hope this resetting of the clock will be interpreted exactly as it is meant: an urgent warning of global danger. The time for world leaders to address looming nuclear danger and the march of climate change is long past. The time for the citizens of the world to demand such action is now. It is time to rewind the Doomsday Clock.

31," As Florence lumbered further north Tuesday, dumping heavy rains on New England, the Carolinas continued to deal with the aftermath of the storm, which claimed at least 33 lives and stranded thousands of people in floodwaters. The storm has prompted thousands of rescues, sent at least 17,000 people in the Carolinas into shelters, derailed a freight train, plunged hundreds of thousands of homes into darkness and flooded roadways from small streets to major interstates. Flooding remained a major concern, and officials in North Carolina were monitoring vulnerable dams for potential breaches. VIEW PHOTOS Rainfall totals could reach as high as 40 inches in southeastern North Carolina and 15 to 20 inches in the western part of the state. A preliminary report from Swansboro, N.C., showed that more than 30 inches of rain had fallen so far, according to the National Hurricane Center. That broke the tropical cyclone rainfall record of 24.06 inches for North Carolina, which was set during Hurricane Floyd in 1999, it added.

32," With the courts and Trump Administration rolling back federal climate regulation, green activists have turned to the states. But there’s a troubling ethical twist: Instead of merely lobbying, activists are placing employees in Attorneys General offices in dubious private-public condominiums. Consider a remarkable arrangement brokered by the NYU Law School’s State Energy and Environmental Impact Center to fund legal services for state AGs. The group was launched in August 2017 to advance a liberal climate and energy agenda, courtesy of a $6 million grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies, which also financed the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign. In August 2017 the NYU outfit emailed then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman’s office, offering to cover the salary and benefits of “special assistant attorneys general,” pending an application from the office that demonstrated how the new attorneys would be used. These privately funded staffers would work out of an AG’s office for two years and deliver quarterly progress reports to the State Energy and Environmental Impact Center. Those progress reports would explain “the contribution that the legal fellow has made to the clean energy, climate change, and environmental initiatives” within the attorney general’s office, according to a December 2017 draft of an agreement between the Center and the New York AG obtained by Chris Horner of the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Attorneys General do sometimes bring on legal fellows or outside help to handle unique cases. But subject-matter experts aren’t in-house or chosen with specific intent to promote specific policies, according to Randy Pepple, who was chief of staff for former Washington Republican AG Rob McKenna. In the New York case, a special interest is funding staffers who could wield state law-enforcement power to punish opponents. The State Energy and Environmental Impact Center made clear that state AG offices would only qualify for special assistant AGs if they “demonstrate a need and commitment to defending environmental values and advancing progressive clean energy, climate change, and environmental legal positions,” according to the August 2017 email to numerous AGs. Mr. Schneiderman’s office suggested in its application for the fellows that it “needs additional attorney resources to assist” in extracting compensation from fossil-fuel emitters. That’s exactly what’s happening. The New York AG currently has two NYU fellows on staff, according to the State Energy and Environmental Impact Center. One of the fellows, Gavin McCabe, signed off as “special assistant attorney general” on an amicus brief in June in support of New York City’s suit for damages against BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil, and Royal Dutch Shell for alleged climate sins. That case was thrown out in July by federal Judge John Kennan on grounds that problems arising from climate change “are not for the judiciary to ameliorate.” The other, Matthew Eisenson, signed New York state’s suit filed last month against Exxon for allegedly misleading investors about the risks that climate-change regulations pose to its business. The free help will also make for welcome reinforcements in New York-led litigation against the Trump Administration, including a suit against the EPA for its methane regulation. A lack of government transparency makes this arrangement especially troubling. The New York AG’s office, now run by Acting AG Barbara Underwood, declined to comment. Mr. McCabe and Mr. Eisenson could not be reached for comment by our deadline. The State Energy and Environmental Impact Center said in a statement that the state offices it works with “has the authority consistent with applicable law and regulations to accept a Legal Fellow whose salary and benefits are provided by an outside funding source.” It added that it places workers with AGs who already have a long history of advancing the center’s energy priorities. “The work that NYU law fellows perform is directed by those AGs and not by the Center,” the Center said. At least six state AG offices have already brought on board a special assistant attorney general, according to an August report by Mr. Horner. Besides New York, the jurisdictions include Maryland, Massachusetts, Oregon, Washington and the District of Columbia. In September, Mr. Horner learned that Illinois and New Mexico have brought on special assistant AGs as well, which was confirmed by the NYU outfit. The ethical problems here should be obvious. Private interests are leveraging the police powers of the state to pursue their political agenda, while a government official is letting private interests appear to influence enforcement decisions. None of this is reassuring about the fair administration of justice. ",https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-ags-for-rent-1541549567,Medium,-1,Yes,0
33,"In 2012, climate scientist Michael Mann filed a defamation suit against National Review, Mark Steyn, the Competitive Enterprise Institute and Rand Simberg over a hyperbolic blog post written by Simberg for the CEI and quoted approvingly by Steyn on National Review Online.
Opinions to start the day, in your inbox. Sign up.
Last December, after sitting on the case for years, the D.C. Court of Appeals (not to be confused with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit) held that Mann’s suit against the CEI, National Review and Simberg may proceed to trial (Steyn having gone his own way in the litigation).
National Review and CEI promptly filed petitions for rehearing or rehearing en banc in January. These petitions were supported by several amicus briefs, and the court sought a response from Mann in February.  (These and other filings in the case may be found here.)
Mann’s response was filed over six months ago, and there is still no word from the court. What’s going on? I have no inside knowledge, but I suspect the delay may indicate at least some of the judges are having difficulty with the potential breadth of the initial ruling. As I wrote in March:
Mann was understandably upset by the offending blog post. Yet treating that post as actionable defamation poses a threat to robust political and scientific discourse, for reasons I’ve explained in prior posts. As Popehat’s Ken White noted in an extensive post about the decision, the D.C. Court of Appeals’ decision was “disturbingly deferential to Mann’s defenders in a way that . . . undermines dissent.” It’s the sort of approach to defamation one expects from President Trump, not from a respected court in the nation’s capital. I do not agree with the CEI, et al. on the threat posed by climate change, but I agree even less with the idea of penalizing robust political commentary such as was at issue here.
Climate policy activists have generally supported Mann’s litigation, but they may come to regret this view. If the comments at issue in this case are potentially actionable defamation, then so too are all manner of hyperbolic charges hurled against climate skeptics by environmentalist activists, including accusations that skeptics are corporate shills or paid for their positions. Indeed, Mann himself has made comments over the years that might themselves be actionable.
Allowing all such claims to proceed to trial might be a boon for lawyers, but it would also chill policy debate. For this reason, I hope the D.C. Court of Appeals reconsiders its opinion. . . .
DISCLOSURE: As I’ve noted in prior posts on this case, I am a contributing editor at National Review Online, which means I have a fancier byline when I submit articles to the publication and occasionally contribute to The Corner and Bench Memos. It is not a salaried position. I also worked at the Competitive Enterprise Institute from 1991 to 2000 — many years before the events at issue in this litigation. FWIW, I also have profound disagreements with the CEI on the threat posed by climate change and the appropriate policy response to this threat.

34," A U.K. regulator launched a new code for asset owners and managers, asking them to consider environmental, social and governance factors at companies they are investing in. The Financial Reporting Council’s new stewardship code forces participating pension funds, insurance firms, fund managers and other service providers to show how they protect and enhance the value of their investments for the long term. It replaces an existing code from 2012. U.K. investment managers have about £7.7 trillion ($9.961 trillion) under management, according to figures provided by the Investment Association, an industry group. Application of the code is voluntary. But the Financial Conduct Authority, another U.K. regulator, will require asset managers that don’t follow the code to provide additional explanations, likely incentivizing companies to apply the code. Environmental, social and governance factors are increasingly becoming talking points for companies as consumers and regulators pay closer attention to corporate conduct. Starting Jan. 1, those who sign the code would be required to report annually on their stewardship activity. Signatories must also take into consideration a range of factors when they place their investments. Among the factors: potential effects on the environment, in particular on climate change, a move that comes as more investors pursue environmental, social and corporate-governance goals when putting their clients’ money to work. Data points such as the voting history of asset owners and managers at companies’ annual general meetings also will be evaluated, the FRC said. Signatories to the code are expected to explain how they managed their investments across various asset classes, both inside and outside of the U.K., the FRC said. The audit and accounting regulator plans to conduct regular reviews of how the code is being applied by its users. Under the new code, asset owners and managers would need to explain their organizations’ purpose, strategy and culture. The FRC also wants them to demonstrate their commitment to stewardship by having appropriate corporate governance, resources and incentives for their staff. The U.K. in recent months has positioned itself as a hub for high corporate standards and governance ahead of the country’s planned departure from the European Union. As part of the changes, the FRC issued a new corporate governance code that took effect earlier this year, and increased its scrutiny of audit and accounting firms. “It is an ambitious revision that strengthens the UK’s standards of governance, transparency and clear reporting,” said Simon Dingemans, the FRC’s chairman. “We are looking for widespread adoption by the investment community, reinforcing the attractiveness of the U.K. as a place to do business and delivering real benefits to the economy, the environment and society more broadly.” Write to Nina Trentmann at nina.trentmann@wsj.com ",https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-regulator-asks-asset-owners-managers-to-consider-esg-11571871660,Medium,1,Yes,0
35," A cluster of makers of heavy goods, from steel and cement to glass, leads the companies recognized this year for best practices in managing environmental risk, according to a new ranking by The Wall Street Journal. It might seem odd for such companies, which are heavy users of fossil fuels, to rank so high. But these companies, which say they are responding in the face of mounting regulation and pressure from investors to go greener, are working to find balance between environmental responsibilities, growth and profits. The ranking of the world’s 100 most sustainably managed companies by Journal researchers seeks to highlight companies that are managing the most financially significant environmental risks effectively. “Heavy goods are the backbone of society and economic growth—notably in developing countries—and will be necessary in the coming decades,” says Caroline Le Meaux, head of environmental, social and governance (ESG) research at Paris-based Amundi SA, Europe’s biggest money manager. “They can be part of the low-carbon future envisioned by world leaders,” she says. Companies that scored highly in the Journal’s environment category include Turkey’s biggest maker of iron and steel, Ereğli Demir & Çelik Fabrikaları TAS, at No. 1; London-listed coal miner and steelmaker Evraz EVR -12.59% PLC, at No. 2; Japanese steelmaker JFE Holdings Inc., 5411 -1.15% at No. 4; and Japanese glassmaker AGC Inc., ASGLY 2.41% at No. 5. Taiwanese shipper Evergreen Marine Corp. , which scored well on management of air quality, greenhouse-gas emissions and ecological impacts, took the No. 3 spot. “Manufacturers need to make a rapid shift to low-carbon and sustainable products or risk obsolescence,” says Shaunak Mazumder, fund manager at London-based investment company Legal & General PLC. The WSJ’s ranking is based on more than 5,500 publicly traded companies around the world that met disclosure standards and had policies in place on 26 sustainability categories defined by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. The board is a nonprofit that works with companies and investors to create reporting standards that link sustainability to financial performance. The effects of heavy-goods makers on the environment are considered by the SASB to be more financially significant than those of companies in other industries, like technology and finance. While the former depend on direct usage of land and water and consume huge amounts of energy, technology and financial firms have less exposure because they are in more of a supporting role to those and other types of businesses, says David Parham, director of research projects at SASB. Thus, the costs and revenues of the heavy manufacturers are more likely to be affected by environmental issues, and the companies are more likely to encounter regulatory challenges. Those reasons drove these manufacturers to dominate the top quarter of companies in the environment category of the Journal’s ranking. In addition to those companies already named, Germany’s HeidelbergCement AG HDELY 1.84% came in at No. 8, Thailand’s Siam Cement Ltd. SCC 1.28% was No. 9, and Philadelphia-based metal-can maker Crown Holdings Inc. CCK 1.70% was No. 10. The overall winner in the environmental category, Istanbul-based Ereğli Demir, parent of steelmakers Erdemir and Isdemir, publicly tracks its environmental footprint. According to Ereğli Demir, which declined to comment for this article, it has invested $675 million over the past three years in sustainability, product development, productivity, R&D, innovation and environment-related projects. It also has planted tens of thousands of trees since 2011. Energy-efficiency upgrades saved Ereğli Demir nearly $29 million last year and helped cut emissions, the company says in its 2019 sustainability report. “We believe that efforts such as these will be the primary sources of our competitive strength in the years ahead,” the report says.

The company has ties to the Turkish military and government. Its single-biggest investor is Turkey’s military pension fund, Oyak, with a stake of slightly more than 49%. Oyak, a big investor in industries across Turkey, says it is independent from the military. Oyak was given opportunity to comment but didn’t respond in time for publication. Ereğli Demir’s sustainability efforts, meanwhile, helped it win a loan of €115 million, equal to about $136 million, from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development since 2016 to improve its energy efficiency and cut emissions, according to a release by the bank. “The methods by which heavy goods are produced and used will ultimately impact our ability to reach a low-carbon state,” says Jordan Farris, head of exchange-traded funds at investment firm Nuveen LLC. See The Wall Street Journal’s overall ranking of the 100 most sustainably managed companies in the world, or sort by category. The Chicago-based money manager holds Ereğli Demir in its Nuveen ESG Emerging Markets Equity ETF, a $46 million fund invested in companies based on their environmental, social and governance practices. Although it is hard to predict the role that heavy goods will play in the low-carbon economy that world leaders envision in the coming decades, Mr. Farris says it is safe to assume that goods such as steel, glass and cement will be needed to build infrastructure. What’s more, companies that don’t tackle environmental management are not only putting their brand value at risk, they are missing out on opportunities to save money by cutting waste, water and energy, says Seb Beloe, partner at London-based sustainable investing firm WHEB Asset Management. A weekly chat about the environmental and social issues that influence the way we work, spend our money and live our lives. Click to preview.. While the United Nations warns that the world has less than a decade to drastically lower its emissions before causing irreversible devastation from sea level and temperature increases, Mr. Beloe says companies and investors that address these challenges and make the right bets “can make good money by doing so.” Evraz PLC, No. 2 in the global environment ranking, first set green targets in 2012. It scored well in the recent ranking with regard to air quality and waste management. The London-listed company operates in Russia, the U.S., Canada, Czech Republic and Kazakhstan. It has invested more than $174 million in environmental projects to cut emissions and boost energy efficiency at its sites. Efforts include switching from burning coal to burning waste for power and installing collectors of excess gas. The company has plans to invest $50 million for environmental works this year, according to its sustainability reports. It says it achieved 105.2% recycling of waste emanating from iron and steel production last year—exceeding 100% by recycling material that had previously been sent to dump sites—up from 96.6% in 2010. For steelmakers like Ereğli Demir and Evraz, coal remains a largely irreplaceable ingredient in most steel furnaces, though electric-arc furnaces that burn mainly scrap metal have gained ground. Evraz has five blast furnaces and four electric-arc furnaces, including one in Pueblo, Colo., that the company says should run on solar power by the end of next year thanks to $285 million from investors and solar developer Lightsource BP. “There’s still no equal substitute for steel in infrastructure,” says Aleksey Ivanov, senior vice president of Evraz, in an email. Still, Evraz’s environmental targets are less aggressive than those of Luxembourg’s ArcelorMittal and India’s Tata Steel Ltd. , says Tom Crocker, research analyst at the climate-change-disclosure nonprofit CDP. Those two steelmakers didn’t make the WSJ rankings due to poorer performance in other sustainability areas. Mr. Crocker also says Evraz’s focus on efficiency upgrades is too incremental. Compared with its peers, Evraz’s carbon-intensity target of below two metric tons of carbon-dioxide per metric ton of steel is “highly unambitious” and “not in line with any science-based trajectory and is very short term in nature,” he says. “It has not been proactive, and is still operating on a business-as-usual trajectory,” he says of the company. An Evraz spokesman says the steelmaker’s senior management held several discussions in March and June on its environmental policy and climate change after the board requested they review the issues. In late June, he says the company completed a climate-change scenario analysis and mapped its risks and opportunities alongside its impacts and mitigation efforts, based on guidelines from the Michael Bloomberg -backed Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the UN. The move toward consistent science-based climate targets and disclosures, which is the focus of CDP’s and TCFD’s recommendations, is not explicitly incorporated in WSJ’s scoring methodology, which focuses on sustainability topics considered material to a company’s finances, according to the SASB framework. Shifting to another heavy industry, shipping, No. 3 Evergreen Marine, a shipper of heavy goods from the Far East to the American East Coast, raised more than $68 million in green bonds in 2018 to reduce emissions by its cargo vessels. Green bonds are used to help fund environmental and socially themed initiatives, such as cutting emissions, and they include financial disincentives for the issuer in case specific goals aren’t met. Evergreen Marine reports that its total CO2 emissions fell 36.2% from 2008 to 2018, and that it aims for a further 40% cut by 2030. It has installed and continues to add ecological safeguards on its ships, ranging from sulfur-dioxide scrubbers and efficient refrigerators to oil-water separators and nontoxic paint, according to its most recent sustainability report. Carole Ferguson, head of investor research at CDP, says Evergreen Marine has done a good job of working with original-equipment makers to increase the efficiency of its vessels. On the other hand, she says, the company doesn’t share enough details about its management of emissions related to specific activities. “The [shipping] sector as a whole suffers from not having the transformative technologies in place,” Ms. Ferguson says. “Locking into technologies that have marginal efficiency improvements may not allow alignment to the scale of cuts in emissions required.” Evergreen Marine declines to comment for this article. The only U.S. company in the Journal’s environment top 10 is Crown, a maker of metal packaging, including beverage and food cans, with more than 200 plants across 47 countries. Crown scored highly for its management of water, waste and air quality. All of the electricity used by Crown’s beverage-container plants in the U.S. and Canada will be fully matched by wind power this year as it aims for total renewable energy world-wide by 2050. The company also points to how metal is one of the most easily recycled materials, with nearly half of aluminum cans getting recycled in the U.S., according to the Aluminum Association, a trade group. John Rost, vice president of sustainability and regulatory affairs at Crown, says it is much easier to recycle metal packaging than plastic or glass since there is more infrastructure in place and the material stays in better shape for reuse. Fellow metal-container maker Ball Corp. says the industry in North America missed an opportunity worth some $400 million in revenue last year by not recycling more aluminum cans. “We really are fortunate,” Mr. Rost says, “to be working in a material that is infinitely recyclable.” Mr. Holger is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in Barcelona.

36,"The culmination of Bernie Sanders's remarkable run at the presidency arrived Monday night as the senator from Vermont addressed the delegates who'd gathered in Philadelphia to nominate his opponent as the Democratic candidate for president.
Sanders walked out on stage to rapturous applause from supporters who, earlier in the day, had made their displeasure with the results of the 14-month contest very clear. The applause was heavy and sustained. Several Sanders supporters in the audience had tears in their eyes.
When the tumult had calmed down — at least somewhat — Sanders began his speech endorsing Hillary Clinton.
It was, to a large extent, the same speech he gave when he endorsed Clinton in New Hampshire two weeks ago.
Here's Bernie Sanders's full speech from Portsmouth, N.H. July 12, where he endorses rival Hillary Clinton. (Video: Reuters, Photo: BRIAN SNYDER/Reuters)
You can compare the two yourself. Here's the New Hampshire speech; here's the convention speech as prepared for delivery.

The replication is most obvious at the conclusion of the speech. New Hampshire:
It is no secret that Hillary Clinton and I disagree on a number of issues. That’s what this campaign has been about. That’s what democracy is about. But I am happy to tell you that at the Democratic Platform Committee, which ended Sunday night in Orlando, there was a significant coming together between the two campaigns and we produced, by far, the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party. Our job now is to see that platform implemented by a Democratic Senate, a Democratic House and a Hillary Clinton presidency — and I am going to do everything I can to make that happen.
I have known Hillary Clinton for 25 years. I remember her as a great first lady who broke precedent in terms of the role that a first lady was supposed to play as she helped lead the fight for universal health care. I served with her in the United States Senate and know her as a fierce advocate for the rights of children.
Hillary Clinton will make an outstanding president and I am proud to stand with her here today.
At the convention:
It is no secret that Hillary Clinton and I disagree on a number of issues. That’s what this campaign has been about. That’s what democracy is about. But I am happy to tell you that at the Democratic Platform Committee there was a significant coming together between the two campaigns and we produced, by far, the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party. Among many other strong provisions, the Democratic Party now calls for breaking up the major financial institutions on Wall Street and the passage of a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act. It also calls for strong opposition to job-killing free trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

Hillary Clinton will make an outstanding president and I am proud to stand with her here tonight.
The parts that were added on Monday are in bold.
The five paragraphs preceding the conclusion were all copied nearly verbatim. Even Sanders's story about the working mother he met in Nevada was told two weeks prior. The priorities he listed were mostly the same, and the language he used to list them was, too. Oddly, he'd done the same thing on July 12, lifting heavily from the speech he gave when he first addressed his followers after the D.C. primary.
Where did Sanders's speech on Monday night differ from his one two weeks ago? On a new agreement with Clinton on addressing student debt, for one.
Recently, however, we have come together on a proposal that will revolutionize higher education in America. It will guarantee that the children of any family this country with an annual income of $125,000 a year or less — 83 percent of our population — will be able to go to a public college or university tuition-free. That proposal also substantially reduces student debt.
He also added language about the decline of the middle class and income inequality, saying that ""[i]t is not moral, not acceptable and not sustainable that the top one-tenth of 1 percent now own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, or that the top 1 percent in recent years has earned 85 percent of all new income.""
The Clinton campaign first saw Sanders' speech early this evening, aide says
— Jennifer Epstein (@jeneps) July 26, 2016
But beyond that, the change was in his initial endorsement.

This election is about which candidate understands the real problems facing this country and has offered real solutions — not just bombast, fearmongering, name-calling and divisiveness. We need leadership in this country which will improve the lives of working families, the children, the elderly, the sick and the poor. We need leadership which brings our people together and makes us stronger — not leadership which insults Latinos, Muslims, women, African Americans and veterans — and divides us up. By these measures, any objective observer will conclude that — based on her ideas and her leadership — Hillary Clinton must become the next president of the United States. The choice is not even close.
It's that passage that did most of the work he was there to accomplish: To make the case to those enthusiastic supporters that they should transfer that affection to Clinton — or, barring that, to at least transfer their votes.
""I understand that many people here in this convention hall and around the country are disappointed about the final results of the nominating process,"" he said. ""I think it’s fair to say that no one is more disappointed than I am.""
That part was new.

This election is about that woman, and the millions of other workers in this country who are falling further and further behind as they try to survive on totally inadequate wages.

Hillary Clinton understands that we must fix an economy in America that is rigged and that sends almost all new wealth and income to the top one percent. Hillary Clinton understands that if someone in America works 40 hours a week, that person should not be living in poverty. She believes that we should raise the minimum wage to a living wage. And she wants to create millions of new jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. – our roads, bridges, water systems and wastewater plants.

But her opponent – Donald Trump – well, he has a very different view. He believes that states should have the right to lower the minimum wage or even abolish the concept of the minimum wage altogether. If Donald Trump is elected, we will see no increase in the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour – a starvation wage.

This election is about overturning Citizens United, one of the worst Supreme Court decisions in the history of our country. That decision allows the wealthiest people in America, like the billionaire Koch brothers, to spend hundreds of millions of dollars buying elections and, in the process, undermine American democracy.

This election is about climate change, the greatest environmental crisis facing our planet, and the need to leave this world in a way that is healthy and habitable for our kids and future generations. Hillary Clinton is listening to the scientists who tell us that if we do not act boldly in the very near future there will be more drought, more floods, more acidification of the oceans, more rising sea levels. She understands that we must work with countries around the world in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy – and that when we do that we can create a whole lot of good paying jobs.
Donald Trump: Well, like most Republicans, he chooses to reject science – something no presidential candidate should do. He believes that climate change is a hoax. In fact, he wants to expand the use of fossil fuel. That would be a disaster for our country and our planet.

37," President Trump’s recent blowup over General Motors layoffs was largely misdirected, though it may spur at least one good policy result. Killing subsidies for electric cars and trucks would be a victory for taxpayers, the federal fisc and the car industry. Mr. Trump’s initial response to GM’s plant closure news was to threaten to punish the company by stripping its federal subsidies. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow later acknowledged that Mr. Trump can’t legally single out GM for subsidy retribution. Instead the White House may take the better route of proposing to eliminate subsidies for electric vehicles, in particular the $7,500 consumer tax credit for battery-powered cars. That handout began as part of the Obama 2009 “stimulus,” and as always supporters said it would be temporary. A decade on, GM, Nissan and Tesla are nearing or exceeding the 200,000-per-manufacturer cap on EV sales that qualify for the full credit. So they are now seeking increases in the cap, joined by other car makers and Democrats preaching climate alarm. The credits are a classic middle-class-to-rich income transfer. EV batteries are expensive, which means the average starting price for electric cars is around $42,000. That’s some $8,000 more than the average price of a new vehicle, and $22,000 more than the average price of a new gasoline-powered small car. Wayne Winegarden of the Pacific Research Institute looked at 2014 IRS data and found that 79% of federal EV tax credits were claimed by households with adjusted gross income of more than $100,000. Only 1% of EV buyers earned less than $50,000. Some states and localities also hand out EV breaks, allowing consumers to reap up to $15,000 (California) or $10,500 (Connecticut) per car. This means the federal program is also a geographic wealth transfer, benefiting mainly wealthy coastal havens. The latest sales data from August shows that 53% of EV sales were in California. The subsidy will cost some $2 billion through fiscal 2019. And taxpayers will also have shelled out another $5.5 billion directly to car makers in federal grants and loans for manufacturing and technology programs by 2019, according to the Winegarden data. Yet this largesse has not changed the economics of the electric car market. Despite advances in EV technology and all of this government support, most auto makers sell their electric vehicles at a loss. A 2016 Bloomberg News story reported that GM could lose as much as $9,000 on every Chevrolet Bolt. Automakers stick with these EV losers because nearly a dozen states have adopted mandates requiring that EVs make up a certain percentage of all vehicle sales. Even then, most consumers need coaxing to buy. When Georgia ended its $5,000 state tax credit in 2015, sales of electric vehicles fell 89% in two months. EVs have been on the market since 2010 and are still only about 0.5% of total vehicle sales. Auto makers worry that without federal subsidies the state EV mandates may make EV production financially ruinous. But then states should end the mandates, or they can pick up the federal $7,500 tab. As for climate change, studies show that total CO2 emissions from EV cars can even exceed those of conventional gas vehicles—depending on what fuel is producing the electricity to charge the batteries (coal) and how long a car battery charge lasts. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said this month that the White House will “seriously consider” ending EV subsidies in its next budget, and that could be useful policy leverage with House Democrats. If electric cars are the future, let them earn that success in an unsubsidized marketplace. ",https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-electric-kool-aid-subsidy-test-11546201813,Medium,-1,Yes,0
38," Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV employees believed the auto maker used illegal software in diesel-powered vehicles to cheat on U.S. emissions tests and concealed it from regulators, according to allegations by plaintiffs’ lawyers in federal court documents unsealed Monday. The documents cite communications by Fiat Chrysler officials as part of a deposition request and refer to several employees allegedly having misgivings about the company’s use of software affecting emissions. The plaintiffs’ lawyers cite internal chat rooms and external emails in which employees allegedly discuss the use of “defeat devices,” which are emission-control components that improperly manipulate pollution emanating from tailpipes. The disclosures, filed as part of shareholder litigation in Manhattan federal court, follow allegations last year from U.S. authorities and consumers that the Italian-U.S. auto maker used such improper software to allow diesel-powered pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles to appear to meet emissions standards and then pollute far beyond legal limits on the road. Fiat Chrysler, which has consistently denied improperly manipulating emissions since allegations emerged more than a year ago, said the statements plaintiffs’ lawyers referenced were taken out of context. “It is inappropriate to draw conclusions from isolated communications and internal deliberations, without the more detailed context that is part of the reviews FCA is conducting as part of the investigation process,” the auto maker said. Fiat Chrysler said it “will defend vigorously against any claims that FCA US engaged in any deliberate scheme to install defeat devices or to cheat emissions tests.” Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne has repeatedly denied the auto maker knowingly used defeat devices to cheat on emissions tests. Plaintiffs’ lawyers challenged that in the unsealed documents, citing an email exchange in which the CEO reprimands a spokesman for publicly denying the use of the illegal devices. “Are you out of your goddam [sic] mind?,” Mr. Marchionne allegedly asked the spokesman in a Sept. 22, 2015, email, calling the public comment “utterly stupid and unconscionable.” Fiat Chrysler said Monday Mr. Marchionne’s response came just days after an emissions-cheating scandal involving Volkswagen AG was disclosed in 2015 and before Fiat Chrysler had an opportunity to conduct an internal review of its own program. “It is understandable that our CEO would have a forceful response to any employee who would opine on such a significant and complex matter, without the matter having been fully reviewed through the appropriate channels,” the auto maker said. Volkswagen last year pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the U.S. and has paid billions of dollars in legal settlements after admitting to a long-running conspiracy to install illegal software on nearly 600,000 diesel-powered vehicles. The defeat devices allowed vehicles to pass government emissions tests and then pollute far above allowable limits on the roadway. The Monday disclosures regarding Fiat Chrysler come as the auto maker conducts settlement talks with the U.S. Justice Department in the wake of a lawsuit federal prosecutors filed last year. It accused the auto maker of violating the Clean Air Act by allowing vehicles to pollute more than 20 times beyond the legal limit. The Justice Department suit, which followed earlier Environmental Protection Agency allegations, accused Fiat Chrysler of using illegal software in 104,000 diesel-powered Jeep Grand Cherokee SUVs and Ram pickup trucks from the 2014-2016 model years. Authorities said the violations could cost Fiat Chrysler billions of dollars in penalties. The Justice Department earlier this year sent a letter to Fiat Chrysler lawyers outlining an expectation of “substantial” financial penalties in its civil case against the auto maker, a person familiar with the matter has said. But no specific financial figure was raised during recent negotiations, this person said. In a June 2016 chat room discussion cited in the New York litigation, a Fiat Chrysler manager called a software function used in 2014-2016 model year vehicles “essentially a defeat device,” according to the court documents from the plaintiffs’ lawyers. The same employee describes that software as a defeat device and refers to other employees as “cheaters” in early 2013 emails, the documents said. In another exchange, a Fiat Chrysler manager in charge of performance and fuel economy testing, wrote in a November 2015 email that he “did some coaching” on how the company should engage with regulators about its use of certain emissions software. “We can say that maybe the calibration is not as robust in certain conditions but nothing [on] that there should have been an [auxiliary emissions control device] disclosed,” the documents quote him as writing.

39," California Attorney General Kamala Harris on Thursday said Volkswagen AG would pay $86 million in civil penalties as part of an agreement with the state over the company’s emissions-cheating scandal. The German auto maker earlier had separately agreed to pay up to $14.7 billion to settle a raft of government and consumer claims related to its cheating on emissions standards. Volkswagen said the $86 million it would pay to California is part of agreements the company announced last week with 44 U.S. states,the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico to resolve consumer-protection claims for $603 million. Europe’s largest auto maker by volume also has agreed with California to conditions to deter any future misconduct, including a new requirement that Volkswagen contractors and employees report to the attorney general the use of any so-called defeat devices, Ms. Harris said.  Of the $86 million in penalties against Volkswagen, California plans to fund $10 million in grants for research and development of technology to detect devices used to skirt emissions testing and for better assessing on-road emissions. Volkswagen’s software allowed diesel vehicles to pollute more on the road than during emissions testing, spewing nitrogen oxides at up to 40 times the allowable standard, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Volkswagen’s chief executive at the time, Martin Winterkorn, resigned soon after the scandal broke and Volkswagen has endured a barrage of criticism from government officials, consumers and shareholders. Under its earlier broad settlement with U.S. authorities, the car maker is paying up to $10.03 billion to owners of 475,000 affected vehicles with two-liter diesel engines, including Jetta, Passat, Beetle, Golf and Audi A3 models. Volkswagen also will pay $2.7 billion to an environmental remediation fund and $2 billion to promote zero-emission vehicle technology. Some $1.18 billion of that broader settlement has already been slated for California, authorities have said. Volkswagen reached that $14.7 billion broad civil settlement, the largest for an auto maker, with the U.S. Justice Department, the EPA, the Federal Trade Commission, California regulators and consumer plaintiffs. --Sara Randazzo and Mike Spector contributed to this article Write to Ezequiel Minaya at ezequiel.minaya@wsj.com ",http://www.wsj.com/articles/vw-to-pay-california-86-million-more-in-penalties-over-emissions-cheating-1467919247,Medium,1,Yes,0
40," LONDON—Major traders and sellers of liquefied natural gas will begin to look to new markets over the next five years as demand from traditional centers wanes, the International Energy Agency said in a report. In parallel, global supply is set to grow exponentially, putting pressure on prices in the spot market. Cheaper prices for alternative fuels, such as coal, will also soften gas prices, while more carbon-efficient technologies could push demand away from natural gas and toward renewables. The market will likely find strength in China, India and Southeast Asia as Japan and South Korea buy fewer volumes, the IEA said. Chinese gas demand slowed to around 4% in 2015, leading to fewer purchases on the spot market. But demand is likely to recover, as the country diversifies its energy sources away from dirtier fuels, such as coal, to work toward improving air quality. Chinese demand remains the largest downside risk to overall gas demand growth, the IEA said. The extent to which efforts are made to improve environmental policy and the speed at which industrial activity picks up will determine the rate at which demand grows. Indian gas demand will rise to around 6% each year until 2021, the body said. India is a price-sensitive LNG buyer, and as international prices fall, demand is set to encourage buyers to import gas. But in the short term, sellers will focus on Europe as a market for their excess volumes of LNG. “We are at the start of a new chapter in European gas markets,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said. But there is a question mark over how much natural gas Europe can actually absorb. The IEA projects European gas demand to increase only modestly over the medium term. As Russia competes with volumes from the U.S., Gazprom is likely to adopt a more competitive and flexible approach to gas pricing, possibly reducing demand for LNG volumes in the region. The body has dropped its global demand forecast figures from 2% to 1.5% each year until 2021, to reach 3.9 trillion cubic meters. A slowing global economy is reducing demand for fossil fuels. Global liquefaction supply will increase by 45% between 2015 and 2021, according to the IEA. Volumes will mostly increase from Australia and the U.S. Qatar’s position as the world’s largest exporter of natural gas will be challenged by Australia. Qatar’s gas is exported from the super-major 77 million tons a year Ras Laffan export facility. LNG contracts are also set to become more flexible as trading dynamics change. Traditional oil-linked pricing is likely to be replaced or mixed with natural gas hub pricing. Some producers have already moved toward hub pricing. U.S. Sabine Pass volumes are linked to prices at Henry Hub.

41," Growing up in Buffalo, N.Y., I took electricity for granted. Nearby was Niagara Falls, whose hydroelectric power stations, pulsing with kilowatts for the 1901 Pan-American Exposition, made Buffalo America’s City of Light—the nation’s first wholly electrified large metropolis. Statues of Nikola Tesla adorned our parks. In the place of my boyhood, electricity was dependable and low-priced. Isn’t that how it is for everyone? Later I lived in Pakistan, where the government’s Water and Power Development Authority, or Wapda, staged regular rolling blackouts. In Pakistan, if the fans turned for a few hours, that was a good day. By Robert Bryce
(PublicAffairs, 322 pages, $28) Then I settled in Bethesda, Md. The Potomac Electric Power Co., or Pepco—once called “the most hated company in America” by Business Insider—made Wapda seem a model of proficiency by comparison. Since 2000, the utility has had six multiday outages in my neighborhood. For Pepco, rain and wind, it seems, are considered unanticipated circumstances. Pakistan and Maryland caused my view of electricity to change. It is not something to be taken for granted, yet it is essential for work, comfort and safety. The need for reliable electricity is something all societies must grapple with, and is the subject of “A Question of Power: Electricity and the Wealth of Nations,” a smart, important book by the energy analyst Robert Bryce. Mr. Bryce sees the modern age as a struggle not for industrialization or political primacy but rather for electricity. “The vast disparity between the rich and the poor” in the world is defined, the author proposes, “by the disparity between those who have electricity and those who scrape by on small quantities of juice or none at all.” There is a nearly direct relationship between reliable electricity and high living standards, Mr. Bryce tells us. About a billion people have little access to electricity; it’s no coincidence that they are also among the worst educated and the most impoverished. Another very large cohort is held back by intermittent electricity that costs too much. Universal, affordable kilowatts should be a cause for the 21st century in the same way that rural electrification was a cause of the young Lyndon Johnson. In China, international trade is widely and properly credited as an important factor in the fantastic reduction of poverty during the present generation; not to be overlooked, however, is the 10-fold increase in availability of electricity since about 1990. Much of the Indian subcontinent and Africa need a big jump in access to electricity next. Animals, fire and steam, Mr. Bryce notes, have been the principal means of harnessing energy for hundreds of thousands of years, while electricity, first from hydropower, has been in common use for only 130 years. Electricity is clearly superior to other forms of energy in terms of clean operation, power density (lots of juice moving through skinny wires makes the skyscraper possible), storage, and the ease of scaling up or down and switching on or off. It allows industry, homeowners and schoolchildren to employ energy in ways that steam or fire never could. Electricity can be good for nature as well, Mr. Bryce contends. Dense, electricity-dependent cities allow nature’s share of Earth’s surface to increase even as the human population keeps growing. As Mr. Bryce tells us, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft not only could not exist without reliable electricity, they have themselves become producers of it as well. The server facilities run by these companies now produce several times the electrical output of Hoover Dam via a range of devices, from diesel generators to solar panels. As the world continues to expand its use of electrically powered products, from cars to ships to very large chemical and mechanical batteries, the advantages offered by electricity should spread to all companies and nations. Mr. Bryce asserts that electricity generation must soar if we are to raise global living standards. For instance, 2.8 billion people live at hot-clime latitudes, but only 8% of them can enjoy air conditioning. Even Bernie Sanders backers in cool Vermont want air conditioning powered by generators. Why shouldn’t everyone, everywhere, want the same? Mr. Bryce sees this as a moral imperative and has no patience for those who make pie-in-the-sky promises of green-only power. “Renewables aren’t going to be enough,” he writes. “Not by a long shot.” While green energy is falling in capital cost and rising in importance, to say that only nonfossil, nonnuclear power should be permitted is tantamount to condemning much of the world to perpetual immiseration. Mr. Bryce favors low-emission natural gas over coal and oil as electricity fuels, then goes on to show in persuasive detail that “there is simply no way to slash global carbon-dioxide emissions without big increases in our use of nuclear energy.” The mathematics of the need for nuclear power is clear, but this is not what the American left, or German mainstream, want to hear. Politicians in many nations are spinning fabulist tales of rapid transition to zero-emission power without the use of the atom. This, Mr. Bryce thinks, only diverts attention from the need for more electricity production using technology that’s practical now. Not far into the future, Mr. Bryce concludes, electricity may be viewed as a human right—essential for a clean, comfortable, materially secure life. More statues of Tesla may be coming. Mr. Easterbrook’s latest book is “It’s Better Than It Looks: Reasons for Optimism in an Age of Fear.” ",https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-question-of-power-review-the-energy-to-survive-11586111962,Medium,-1,Yes,0
