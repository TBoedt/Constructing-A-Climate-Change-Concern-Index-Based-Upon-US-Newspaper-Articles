      "More than a dozen state attorneys general gathered in New York earlier this week, ostensibly to announce their support for President Obama’s efforts to combat global warming and to underscore their intention to collaborate on investigations involving climate-related issues.\n",
      "Want to know how your actions can help make a difference for our planet? Sign up for the Climate Coach newsletter, in your inbox every Tuesday and Thursday.\n",
      "But the undercurrent of Tuesday’s public announcement, which included former vice president and climate activist Al Gore taking a turn at the podium, was anything but subtle: New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and his counterparts from around the country vowed to “collectively, collaboratively and aggressively” investigate whether fossil fuel companies such as ExxonMobil have misled shareholders and the public about what they knew — and when — about the risks of climate change.\n",
      "“We have heard the scientists; we know what’s happening to the planet,” Schneiderman said. “But there is confusion, sowed by those with an interest in profiting from the confusion and creating misperceptions in the eyes of the American public.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Schneiderman began investigating ExxonMobil last fall, subpoenaing documents from the company in the wake of reporting by the Los Angeles Times and the online publication Inside Climate News that showed Exxon’s in-house researchers were concerned about climate change from fossil-fuel emissions decades ago, and yet for a long time, the company publicly raised doubts about the science. \\\n",
      "Schneiderman has leeway to undertake such an investigation under both consumer protection laws and New York’s Martin Act, a securities law that protects investors.\n",
      "New York is investigating Exxon Mobil for allegedly misleading the public about climate change\n",
      "The California attorney general’s office has since initiated its own investigation, and on Tuesday, at least two more attorneys general — Maura Healey of Massachusetts and Claude Walker of the Virgin Islands — said they also had opened inquiries into Exxon’s actions.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Suzanne McCarron, ExxonMobil’s vice president of public and government affairs, said in a statement that the accusations against the company are “politically motivated and based on discredited reporting funded by activist organizations” and that ExxonMobil is “actively assessing all legal options.”\n",
      "She added that the allegations are “preposterous” and “based on the false premise that ExxonMobil reached definitive conclusions about anthropogenic climate change before the world’s experts and before the science itself had matured, and then withheld it from the broader scientific community.” McCarron said the company openly shared findings in peer-reviewed publications and actively contributed to the work of the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n",
      "“The allegations repeated today are an attempt to limit free speech and are the antithesis of scientific inquiry,” McCarron said. “Left unchallenged, they could stifle the search for solutions to the real risks from climate change.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "While ExxonMobil might have been the company publicly in the crosshairs this week, the carefully coordinated announcement in New York could signal the beginning stages of a broader reckoning for big energy companies facing questions about what they knew about climate change, and when.\n",
      "At least Gore seemed to think so.\n",
      "Years from now, the former vice president insisted, the convening of this group of state law enforcement officials will be viewed as “a real turning point” in the efforts to hold to account companies that have deceived investors and the public about climate change. He went as far as to liken the effort to similar action taken decades ago against the tobacco industry, which despite growing health warnings long denied the harmful nature of its products, until state attorneys general led the way in forcing the industry to acknowledge it had known of the potential dangers all along.\n",

      "As ocean warming continues to trigger widespread destruction of coral reefs, a decade-long study of remote islands in the Central Pacific suggests these biodiversity hot spots may nonetheless be able to thrive.\n",
      "With many parts of the globe in the grip of a coral reef bleaching event — fueled in part by El Niño-driven ocean warming — scientists and marine conservation advocates have feared many reefs could suffer irreparable damage and fade from existence in coming decades.\n",
      "A new report from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California at San Diego provides reason for optimism by highlighting the potential for preservation efforts. In a massive project spanning 56 islands, researchers documented 450 coral reef locations from Hawaii to American Samoa.\n",
      "The results show that coral reefs surrounding remote islands were dramatically healthier than those in populated areas that were subject to a variety of human impacts.\n",
      "“There are still coral reefs on this planet that are incredibly healthy and probably look the way they did 1,000 years ago,” said Jennifer Smith, lead author of the study and a professor at Scripps’s Center for Marine Biodiversity and Conservation.\n",
      "“The scientists were practically in tears when we saw some of these reefs,” she added. “We’ve never experienced anything like it in our lives. It was an almost religious experience.”\n",
      "[Here’s what a scientist is doing to create corals that can survive warm seas]\n",
      "Teeming with sharks, manta rays, jellyfish and sea turtles, these remote locations contrasted starkly with the heavily populated areas, which were encircled by coral reefs covered in murky seaweed and lacking much of the colorful algae that helps to cement a reef.\n",
      "In recent decades, coral reef ecosystems worldwide have suffered significantly from overfishing, coastal development and the dumping of toxic substances into ocean waters. Scientists have predicted that up to 70 percent of coral reefs could be lost by mid-century.\n",
      "Occupying less than a tenth of 1 percent of the ocean’s sea floor, coral reefs are estimated to be home to nearly a quarter of all marine species. They also provide several human benefits, including food, tourism and flood protection for coastline developments.\n",
      "The new study may catalyze preservation efforts, which some have viewed as futile, said Stephanie Wear, senior scientist for the coral reef conservation program at the Nature Conservancy.\n",
      "“I think it can energize people who are responsible for managing [reefs] that what they’re doing really does matter,” she said. “There are certainly people out there who have said, ‘There’s no point; climate change is going to be the end of reefs,’ and I absolutely disagree with that.”\n",
      "Still, localized efforts to safeguard coral reefs probably will only stave off the worst impacts of global warming for so long, said Nancy Knowlton, a coral reef biologist and holder of the Smithsonian Institution’s Sant Chair for Marine Science.\n",
      "“The question is: ‘How long will reefs be able to stay healthy in the context of much more frequent warming events and ocean acidification?’ ” said Knowlton, who previously worked at Scripps and participated in the coral reef project’s initial research. “I think most reef scientists will say there are limits.”\n",
      "“What this study shows is that protection in a variety of different ways buys us incredibly valuable time while we figure out how to deal with the threat posed by climate change,” she added.\n",

      "2016 is the 200th anniversary of the so-called “year without a summer.” This post was originally published in 2015.\n",
      "Two hundred years ago, a massive volcanic eruption in Indonesia rocked the globe. Ash shot miles into the sky when Mount Tambora exploded. A wall of hot gas and rocks sped down the mountainside and destroyed the city of Tambora. The ash that was lofted into the atmosphere spread far across the Northern Hemisphere and left the Earth in the midst of a year without a summer.\n",
      "[Photo gallery: Colbuco volcano erupts in Chile]\n",
      "Volcanic eruptions are climate wild cards. No eruption illustrates that more than Mount Tambora, which blew its top in April 1815. Tambora’s blasts and the tsunamis they caused killed an estimated 92,000 people, including those who starved to death because the explosion of debris killed livestock and crops.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Though no one realized it at the time, we now know that Tambora’s eruption was the major cause of the following year, 1816, being cooler than average across the Northern Hemisphere.\n",
      "Tambora’s ash-cloud of sulfur-dioxide shot more than 20 miles high into the atmosphere — higher than where our day-to-day weather takes place — to a layer called the stratosphere. Weather and winds are very stable in the stratosphere, and once something gets to that level, it takes a long time to “wash” it out.\n",
      "The newly-formed, sunlight-absorbing cloud spread far and wide around the globe, preventing the sun’s rays from warming the surface of the Earth. The average temperature of the globe dropped a mere 3 degrees, but that small change proved dramatic for not only Earth’s climate but for life in the Northern Hemisphere.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "[Chilean village a ghost town after Calbuco’s blasts]\n",
      "Some of the worst effects, including summer-time frost, impacted the eastern U.S. as far south as Virginia. In Europe and Great Britain the volcano’s effects included not only the coolest summer on record, but day after day of cloud-covered skies and above normal rainfall, which caused widespread crop failures, outbreaks of disease and famine.\n",
      "Thus the year was marked in the climate annals as the Year Without a Summer.\n",
      "In addition to its effects on weather, the Tambora eruption triggered literary side effects that are with us today.\n",
      "During the summer of 1816, the poets George Gordon Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, his wife-to-be, Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, Mary’s stepsister Claire Clairmont, and Bryon’s physician, John William Polidori, spent that summer on Lake Geneva in Switzerland.\n",
      "“At first,” the future Mary Shelley wrote, “we spent our pleasant hours on the lake or wandering on its shores. But it proved a wet, ungenial summer and incessant rain often confined us for days to the house.” The group passed the gloomy days reading and talking about German ghost stories. Byron suggested a ghost story writing contest, which encouraged Mary to write about a “Dr. Victor Frankenstein,” who creates a monster that he brings to life. Shelley encouraged Mary to enlarge the story into a novel, which was published in 1818 as Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Polidori wrote a short story, The Vampyre, a prototype of the long line of vampire stories that are still very much with us.\n",
      "While no one in 1816 realized that Tambora had global effects, another huge Indonesian eruption — Mount Krakatoa on Aug. 23, 1883, which killed an estimated 36,000 people — was evidence that what happens around a volcano doesn’t stay around the volcano.\n",
      "By 1883, the world was connected by undersea telegraph cables and overland telegraph lines. Within hours of the Krakatoa eruption, news spread around the globe, including to the community of professional and amateur sky watchers, who in the weeks and months after the eruption shared their observations.\n",
      "Krakatoa’s ash — tiny pieces of rock the blast had pulverized — first spread around the tropics and then slowly north and south. By November it was in the sky as far north as England, where the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins wrote of a green, blue, copper, and magenta sky: “… more like inflamed flesh than the lucid reds of ordinary sunsets… the glow is intense; that is what strikes everyone; it has prolonged the daylight, and optically changed the season; it bathes the whole sky, it is mistaken for the reflection of a great fire.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Krakatoa’s effects on global weather weren’t as pronounced as those following the much larger 1815 Tambora eruption. But in 1884, the average Northern Hemisphere summer temperatures fell by as much as 2 degrees. Some regions recorded unusual weather, such as the record amounts of rain that fell in California during the July 1, 1883 through June 30, 1884 water year. The 38.18 inches of rain that fell in Los Angeles during this period remains the city’s wettest on record.\n",
      "The global spread of Krakatoa’s ash gave atmospheric scientists their first clues that high-altitude, high-speed winds (what we now know as jet streams) circle the globe.\n",
      "The Chilean government has issued a health warning on Thursday for people living in the vicinity of the Calbuco volcano which continues to spew smoke and ash into the sky. (Video: Reuters)\n",
      "By the early 1980s, some scientists were thinking that sulfur dioxide in volcanic eruptions, not the ash, causes the widespread climatic effects of some volcanoes. Their hypothesis was that the sulfur dioxide a volcano shoots high into the air combines with water vapor to form sulfuric acid, which quickly condenses into tiny sulfate aerosols. As winds carry these aerosols around the earth, they absorb some solar radiation, which warms the stratosphere where absorption is occurring while cooling earth’s surface below.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Changing the locations of areas of warm and cold air affects patterns of high and low atmospheric pressure from the stratosphere down to the surface. These changes, in turn, affect the speeds and directions of winds aloft and at the surface with related changes in temperature and precipitation patterns.\n",
      "The 1982 eruption of the El Chichon volcano in Mexico, in conjunction with the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens helped confirm the hypothesis. While the Mount St. Helens eruption had lowered global average temperatures by roughly 0.1 degrees Celsius, the much smaller amount of ash from El Chichon cooled the globe three to five times as much.\n",
      "Data from NASA’s Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS), which had been launched in 1978, showed that sulfur aerosols probably were the culprit. TOMS, which measures other atmospheric gases as well as ozone, showed that El Chichon produced 40 times as much sulfur dioxide as Mount St. Helens.\n",
      "In addition, while a volcano’s ash falls out of the stratosphere within days or at most weeks, the veil of sulfuric acid takes months to precipitate out. It has more time to affect climate.\n",
      "Ash from each volcano has a unique signature based on the different amounts of various kinds of rocks the blast shattered to create the ash. Scientists who measured amounts of sulfur dioxide found in ice cores in Greenland, Antarctica, and various glaciers found have found that “signatures” of Tambora, Krakatoa and some other major volcanoes correlate well with subsequent, short-lived climate changes.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The June 1991 eruption of the Mount Pinatubo volcano in the Philippines left no doubt that sulfur dioxide from volcanoes is the primary way they affect climate. Pinatubo was the 20th century’s second-largest eruption, behind only the 1912 eruption of Novarupta on the Alaska Peninsula in 1912.\n",
      "Its sulfur dioxide cloud was larger than the one from El Chichon or any other volcano since the TOMS satellite was launched. Pinatubo’s cloud cooled the Earth’s surface by almost one degree Fahrenheit. In its 2007 report the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change called Pinatubo the “best-documented explosive volcanic event to date… The growth and decay of aerosols resulting from this eruption have provided a basis for modeling (the effects) due to explosive volcanoes.” In the United States the summer of 1992, was the third coldest and third wettest in 77 years.\n",

      " YOKOSUKA, Japan— Shinjiro Koizumi has led a charmed existence since he entered Japan’s Parliament a decade ago, taking over a seat held by his father, former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. Now, the political prince is being tested in his first cabinet position as he attempts to wean Japan from its dependence on coal, which accounts for more than a quarter of the nation’s electricity. Educated at Columbia University, the 38-year-old Mr. Koizumi is one of the youngest lawmakers in postwar history to join Japan’s cabinet. He was named environment minister in September by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and, fresh off his marriage to glamorous, half-French television personality Christel Takigawa, he looked ready to follow in his father’s footsteps. How can Shinjiro Koizumi navigate his political dilemma? Join the conversation below. Almost immediately after taking office, Mr. Koizumi encouraged environmentalists. “We are committed to realizing a decarbonized society and we are ready to contribute as a more powerful country in the fight against climate change,” he said in New York on the eve of the United Nations Climate Change Summit in September. Tackling climate change has to be made “fun,” “cool” and “sexy,” he added. Back home, however, big businesses that support Prime Minister Abe’s government and officials in charge of energy say a shortage of power isn’t an option. Mr. Koizumi’s political future hinges on whether he can advance his pledge to decarbonize Japan without making enemies of the establishment. “Mr. Koizumi has a great chance of success in his future career if he can show his political capability in tackling the issue of coal,” said Yukari Takamura, a University of Tokyo professor specializing in environmental and international law. Environmentalists also are pushing to halt construction of a coal-fired power plant in Mr. Koizumi’s own parliamentary district south of Tokyo. But “suddenly stopping new coal plants would prove extremely difficult,” said Atsuo Sawaki, a manager at Jera Co., the company that just started building the plant. Asked about coal at a recent news conference, Mr. Koizumi avoided the language he had used in New York. He said Japan was trying to “reduce our level of dependence on thermal power including coal-fired power as much as possible.” Unlike some countries taking an anticoal stance, Mr. Koizumi said that Japan wasn’t blessed with natural resources. “As a major economic power, we need diverse energy sources. I would like people to understand the circumstances we face,” he said. Politicians around the world are grappling with the future of coal, from President Trump, who wants to boost coal and calls environmental regulations too strict, to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose withdrawal from nuclear power has raised her country’s reliance on the fuel. Japan is similar to Germany because public opposition after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear meltdowns of 2011 has made it difficult to restart nuclear reactors taken offline and virtually impossible to complete new projects. Today, only a quarter of Japan’s operable nuclear reactors have been restarted. Among the leaders of the antinuclear campaign is none other than Mr. Koizumi’s father, who said he was misled about nuclear power’s safety while prime minister from 2001 to 2006 and had his eyes opened by the Fukushima accident. In a speech in September, the now 77-year-old Mr. Koizumi said of his son: “I want him to get rid of nuclear energy and make this a country that can flourish with renewable energy.” While renewables are growing, net coal-fired capacity is also expected to grow by 6.8 gigawatts from 2019 to 2023, said Shirley Zhang, a coal-market analyst at energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. “Anything on the downside of nuclear could bring more upside to coal,” she said. In Mr. Koizumi’s district, construction began in August on a 1.3-gigawatt coal-fired power plant due to begin partial operation in 2023. It is set to emit 7.26 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere annually. How can Shinjiro Koizumi navigate his political dilemma? Join the conversation below. The new coal plant replaces an older plant that used to operate on the site, and, as a result, it received a simplified environmental assessment. A local group is suing to block it. “If we don’t stop the current construction of coal plants, Japan will not be able to meet the requirements of the Paris climate treaty,” said Rikuro Suzuki, a representative of the group. “As environment minister, this is Mr. Koizumi’s job.” The environment ministry is weak, though, compared with the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, which is in charge of energy policy and supports the Yokosuka plant. Backers of coal plants say renewable energy isn’t ready to take a leading role because it is too costly and intermittent. Costs from renewable-energy subsidies are passed on to the public in the form of $22 billion added to electricity bills in the current fiscal year, according to the industry ministry. Mr. Sawaki of Jera, the coal-plant builder, points to Japan’s need to diversify energy sources away from the Middle East. Much of Japan’s liquefied natural gas comes from Qatar and other risky zones, while it can buy coal from Australia and the U.S. Jera already has several new plants in the pipeline that run on natural gas, which produces lower carbon emissions than coal. Its new coal-fired plant in Yokosuka will be more efficient and cleaner than the plant it is replacing, Mr. Sawaki said. “We are trying to decrease emissions as a whole,” he said. The gradualist approach isn’t enough for Junya Ogawa, a member of Parliament who wants taxes placed on polluters to combat global warming. He pressed Mr. Koizumi at a parliamentary debate in October. “Be it sexy, cool, charming—just do something,” Mr. Ogawa said. \n",

      " Regarding Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia’s “Retirees’ Security Trumps Other Social Goals” (op-ed, June 24): All major U.S. asset managers consider the material risks posed by environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors to their investments, because ESG integration is a necessary part of effective risk management. Secretary Scalia’s proposal, issued by the Labor Department (DOL) June 22, completely misunderstands and misinterprets ESG integration. ESG isn’t an asset class, but rather prudent risk management. It applies to all funds across all asset classes across investment processes. It is the DOL’s responsibility to protect savers and the retirement incomes of millions of Americans—which means ensuring our 401(k)s and pensions consider all material risks, including ESG risks. However, this proposal creates more confusion. In Secretary Scalia’s own proposal, the DOL acknowledges explicitly that ESG factors can create business risks and opportunities, and evidence is incontrovertible that climate change will have a material impact on our economy and on asset prices. The administration is once again standing in the way of progress on integration of ESG considerations by investors. As regulators in leading markets around the world move forward with requirements that investment fiduciaries consider ESG factors, the DOL’s proposed rule represents a significant step in the wrong direction—one that is out of sync with markets across the world. The DOL must make clear that fiduciaries have an obligation to consider material ESG factors such as climate-change risks as part of their investment processes.

      " WASHINGTON—President Trump would press forward with efforts to ease regulatory burdens on business if re-elected for a second term, while working to ease bottlenecks that have delayed Superfund cleanup projects, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator Andrew Wheeler said. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Wheeler said a second term for the Trump administration would allow his agency to implement additional measures such as including a cost-benefit analysis of any new regulations. He would also push to expand use of “science transparency,” in which the scientific justification behind new regulations would be disclosed. At the same time, Mr. Wheeler said the EPA would continue to reinvigorate the Superfund program and other efforts to clean up polluted communities across the U.S. He said such efforts had gotten stalled before his arrival because of a focus on process, with resources devoted to measuring cleanup efforts rather than evaluating the results. “We need to make sure we are speaking to people where they live and we’re addressing the problems they see on a daily basis,” he said. Mr. Wheeler said his agency’s focus on completing cleanup efforts led last year to the most deletions from the Superfund sites list since 2001. Environmentalists have criticized Mr. Trump’s emphasis on easing regulatory burdens, and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has offered a starkly different agenda if elected. Mr. Biden has pledged a $2 trillion clean-energy plan to combat climate change, promising to make “historic investments” in new technology that could spur job growth. Under Mr. Biden’s plan, which would be funded by tax increases on corporations and the wealthy, along with stimulus spending, his administration would try to eliminate carbon emissions from the power grid by 2035, put Americans into electric vehicles and zero-emissions mass transit and rebuild roads, bridges and other infrastructure. The plan incorporates recommendations from the United Nations-led panel that calls for reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions to avoid potentially catastrophic results of climate change in coming decades. Mr. Trump has said he doesn’t believe the U.S. government’s assessment of climate change, and his deregulatory policies have undone some of the country’s climate policy. Soon after his election, he said the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris climate accord, saying the terms of complying with the agreement would cost jobs and put the country at a competitive disadvantage. How do you assess President Trump’s second-term agenda for the EPA? Join the conversation below. Mr. Wheeler, 55 years old, was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in February 2019 to become the 15th administrator to lead the agency. He had led it in an acting capacity since July 2018, replacing Scott Pruitt. Under their watch, Mr. Wheeler said there had been reductions in air pollution and more than $40 billion for clean-water infrastructure investment. “The Obama-Biden administration only focused on climate change at the expense of the communities here in the United States and the expense of reducing pollution where people live,” he said. Former EPA water official Betsy Southerland, who left in 2017, called Mr. Wheeler’s progress in delisting Superfund sites “a paperwork exercise to document previously completed cleanups, which can take a decade or more.” “Wheeler has not been diligent in actually cleaning up sites during his tenure,” she said in an emailed statement. “The Trump EPA has the worst record of any previous administration in funding new cleanup projects ready for construction and completing construction of cleanup projects at sites.” Ms. Southerland has criticized Mr. Trump’s policies before. Nearly a year ago she wrote for the Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, that “at Trump’s EPA, the attacks on science have been the most severe and all-encompassing.’’ Mr. Wheeler expanded on his priorities for a possible second Trump term Thursday at the Nixon presidential library in Yorba Linda, Calif. President Nixon created the EPA in 1970. “The EPA’s mission has been straightforward since its founding: protect human health and the environment,” he said at the event. Under Mr. Wheeler’s direction, the agency rolled back several measures put in place by the Obama administration, including a policy that expanded federal oversight and the threat of steep fines for polluting smaller waterways. The policy had been criticized by some farmers, property developers, chemical manufacturers and oil-and-gas producers. A personal, guided tour to the best scoops and stories every day in The Wall Street Journal. White House officials are also updating the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires full environmental-impact statements to be completed within a speedier timeline of two years. The law, enacted in 1970, gave environmentalists and conservationists a voice in planning, allowing them to sue if they thought developers weren’t properly following the law. But some business groups and trade unions said the process had become a tool to delay highways, pipelines and other infrastructure projects. Other measures more directly benefited the U.S. energy sector. Earlier this week, agency officials completed a set of new guidelines for disposing of coal ash and wastewater from coal-fired power plants, changes that critics say could allow more pollutants into waterways. Some of Mr. Trump’s overhauls took longer than expected, while others face challenges in court, where the administration has lost dozens of decisions related to environmental policy and other changes.

      " With the courts and Trump Administration rolling back federal climate regulation, green activists have turned to the states. But there’s a troubling ethical twist: Instead of merely lobbying, activists are placing employees in Attorneys General offices in dubious private-public condominiums. Consider a remarkable arrangement brokered by the NYU Law School’s State Energy and Environmental Impact Center to fund legal services for state AGs. The group was launched in August 2017 to advance a liberal climate and energy agenda, courtesy of a $6 million grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies, which also financed the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign. In August 2017 the NYU outfit emailed then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman’s office, offering to cover the salary and benefits of “special assistant attorneys general,” pending an application from the office that demonstrated how the new attorneys would be used. These privately funded staffers would work out of an AG’s office for two years and deliver quarterly progress reports to the State Energy and Environmental Impact Center. Those progress reports would explain “the contribution that the legal fellow has made to the clean energy, climate change, and environmental initiatives” within the attorney general’s office, according to a December 2017 draft of an agreement between the Center and the New York AG obtained by Chris Horner of the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Attorneys General do sometimes bring on legal fellows or outside help to handle unique cases. But subject-matter experts aren’t in-house or chosen with specific intent to promote specific policies, according to Randy Pepple, who was chief of staff for former Washington Republican AG Rob McKenna. In the New York case, a special interest is funding staffers who could wield state law-enforcement power to punish opponents. The State Energy and Environmental Impact Center made clear that state AG offices would only qualify for special assistant AGs if they “demonstrate a need and commitment to defending environmental values and advancing progressive clean energy, climate change, and environmental legal positions,” according to the August 2017 email to numerous AGs. Mr. Schneiderman’s office suggested in its application for the fellows that it “needs additional attorney resources to assist” in extracting compensation from fossil-fuel emitters. That’s exactly what’s happening. The New York AG currently has two NYU fellows on staff, according to the State Energy and Environmental Impact Center. One of the fellows, Gavin McCabe, signed off as “special assistant attorney general” on an amicus brief in June in support of New York City’s suit for damages against BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil, and Royal Dutch Shell for alleged climate sins. That case was thrown out in July by federal Judge John Kennan on grounds that problems arising from climate change “are not for the judiciary to ameliorate.” The other, Matthew Eisenson, signed New York state’s suit filed last month against Exxon for allegedly misleading investors about the risks that climate-change regulations pose to its business. The free help will also make for welcome reinforcements in New York-led litigation against the Trump Administration, including a suit against the EPA for its methane regulation. A lack of government transparency makes this arrangement especially troubling. The New York AG’s office, now run by Acting AG Barbara Underwood, declined to comment. Mr. McCabe and Mr. Eisenson could not be reached for comment by our deadline. The State Energy and Environmental Impact Center said in a statement that the state offices it works with “has the authority consistent with applicable law and regulations to accept a Legal Fellow whose salary and benefits are provided by an outside funding source.” It added that it places workers with AGs who already have a long history of advancing the center’s energy priorities. “The work that NYU law fellows perform is directed by those AGs and not by the Center,” the Center said. At least six state AG offices have already brought on board a special assistant attorney general, according to an August report by Mr. Horner. Besides New York, the jurisdictions include Maryland, Massachusetts, Oregon, Washington and the District of Columbia. In September, Mr. Horner learned that Illinois and New Mexico have brought on special assistant AGs as well, which was confirmed by the NYU outfit. The ethical problems here should be obvious. Private interests are leveraging the police powers of the state to pursue their political agenda, while a government official is letting private interests appear to influence enforcement decisions. None of this is reassuring about the fair administration of justice. \n",

      " As countries and companies push to counter climate change, nuclear-power firms—key providers of low-carbon energy—are struggling to survive. Shares of Électricité de France SA EDF 0.21% —the world’s largest nuclear-power producer—have shed nearly a third of their value this year. EDF, which operates 73 nuclear reactors around the globe, is wrestling with heavy debt and spiraling upkeep costs, and has recently delayed new projects. In the U.S., nuclear-reactor designer Westinghouse Electric Co. and utilities company FirstEnergy Solutions Corp. have emerged from chapter 11 status over the past year, after struggling with plant construction and battling to compete with declining natural-gas and renewable-energy prices, respectively. Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management bought Westinghouse from Toshiba Corp. TOSYY 0.96% early last year. Deadly accidents such as the ones at Chernobyl and Fukushima remain etched in the public memory, provoking fears of future disaster. “Those accidents all had consequences but they were by far not the worst case scenario,” said Sean Burnie, senior nuclear specialist at Greenpeace Germany. “You don’t have the risk of destroying human society with wind or solar and if the economics don’t add up why would you take that risk?” Advocates for nuclear power argue that almost all nuclear facilities emit negligible amounts of the greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change, and some experts say nuclear power should play a larger role in any changeover away from fossil fuels. The heart of nuclear power’s problem “is a mix: It’s capital intensive but that doesn’t explain everything,” said Patrick Fragman, chief executive of Westinghouse Electric. “The other side of the coin is the uncertainty.” Fickle power prices and unpredictable political enthusiasm make for a less attractive investment pitch, he said. The annual amount of electricity generated by nuclear energy in developed countries declined 13% between 2000 and 2017, according to the International Energy Agency. China, the world’s second-largest economy, accounted for more than two-thirds of new nuclear power in the period. The developed world’s failure to invest in new nuclear plants could mean a more carbon-intensive energy transition—and could add 4 billion tons of CO2 to global emissions by 2040 and increase decarbonization costs for advanced economies by $80 billion, the IEA said in a May report. In addition to public worries, the expense and construction time of new nuclear plants has become more unpredictable. Nuclear projects require relatively high upfront capital expenditure and a long construction time, factors that have deterred private companies in places where governments previously footed the bill. The ensuing drop in demand for new plants has sapped institutional memory, meaning construction is less straightforward and new projects often act as individual prototypes. “The lesson of the past 20 years is that new nuclear power stations are, as an asset class, very difficult projects to finance through the equity market,” said Emmanuel Turpin, utilities analyst at Société Générale. Investors have hammered companies such as EDF in recent months, with debt levels spiraling partly thanks to cost overruns on nuclear projects. EDF’s U.K. project at Hinkley Point C, originally scheduled to be operational by late 2025, has been riddled with delays and is almost $2 billion over budget. Flamanville 3 in France is expected to be commissioned a decade late and at more than triple the initial estimated cost. Historically, the heavy capital expenditure required for nuclear projects has been justified by dependable revenues, often from fixed electricity prices. The rise of cheap natural gas and an accelerating energy transition—lowering the price of renewables—has changed the equation. Gas—with prices down 21% this year—has been one of 2019’s worst-performing commodities. “What we need is stability in political will and decisions around energy,” said Xavier Ursat, senior executive vice president in charge of new nuclear projects at EDF. “If we have stability, and if we can give comfort to investors on the fact that the models we’re developing are the first of their kind and bring them value for money, then we can finance our projects with private money.” U.S. companies have faced similar problems. FirstEnergy Solutions received a billion-dollar bailout from the Ohio state legislature in late July, after the company said its nuclear plants weren’t profitable enough to continue operating. Credit-ratings firm Fitch Group downgraded Westinghouse in June, citing “little demand for new nuclear power plants due to environmental risks, political/regulatory resistance, and lower priced natural gas.” The company filed for bankruptcy in 2017 after it incurred billions of dollars in cost overruns related to four nuclear reactors it was building in the southeastern U.S. Westinghouse was sold by Toshiba to Brookfield Business Partners before it emerged from chapter 11 in August 2018.
