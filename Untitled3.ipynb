      "Kimberley Strassel’s “Trump Is the Ultimate Insider” (Potomac Watch, Feb. 26) expertly demonstrates that Donald Trump is an “insider,” and not at all a “man of the people.” She also might have pointed out that he pretty clearly intends to take no steps to significantly reduce the size of government and its concomitant impact on people and commerce. For my entire life, Republicans have run for office promising to shrink government and “get it off the backs” of the people. Once they get to Washington something stops them from coming close to fulfilling these pledges. Boiling-over frustration at this state of affairs is, ironically enough, a major driver of the Trump phenomenon. He never mentions this problem and is unlikely to address it. If elected, he will focus on the big deals (China, Russia, the Wall, etc.), and leave the bureaucracy largely in place, allowing it to continue to self-perpetuate. What previous Republican presidents have failed to grasp, especially the most recent President Bush, is that maintaining the bureaucratic status quo actually causes government to continue to grow, making things that much worse when the next Democrat gets into the Oval Office and jams down the accelerator, as President Obama has done. This has brought us to the breaking point, which has generated the bubbling rage that drives the Trump train. Will his raging supporters ever realize how unlikely it is that he will ever fix the problem? Geoffrey C. Price NEWSLETTER SIGN-UP Morning Editorial Report All the day's Opinion headlines. Austin, Texas  Mr. Trump has never denied his wealth and its privileges—he embraces them. Who better to bring down the Washington establishment than someone who understands it but stands apart from it. I don’t think the media will ever understand the devotion of Mr. Trump’s supporters. Suffice it to say this line of attack won’t diminish his support. I don’t care about his or any of the other candidates’ tax returns. I’m also not interested in having a beer with him. I’m only interested in turning this country around, and I believe Mr. Trump is the only candidate who can get it done. Camilla Zapolsky Hillsborough, N.C.  As someone who lives and works in Atlantic City, I feel compelled to correct the author’s mischaracterizations concerning Donald Trump’s dealings here. For example, Ms. Strassel writes: Mr. Trump “used city officials to condemn the house of an average American.” Not true. Starting in the late 1970s, the city independently condemned hundreds of houses to pave the way for casino development. The homeowner in question was a feisty widow who turned down Mr. Trump’s personal offer to give her twice what she could expect from eminent domain. It turned out that the courts ruled in her favor because of a narrow interpretation of a municipal law from 1920. Mr. Trump “stiffed” hundreds of vendors when he “ditched” Atlantic City. Not true. Sure, many accounts receivable were compromised when he filed for bankruptcy protection, but while it lasted local vendors were happy to drink from his golden trough. He didn’t “ditch” Atlantic City; our politicians ditched him by building the new convention center away from the boardwalk in the poorest part of town. Mr. Trump would never “have a beer” with the “little people.” Not true. I happened to bump into him one day as he was checking out prices in one of his casino stores. He was by himself and although otherwise engaged, he graciously shook hands and autographed dollar bills for my entire group. He struck me as a “people person” with an uncommon attention to detail. Jon Fox Linwood, N.J.  The class I have a problem with is the career politicians, party administrators and federal bureaucrats who have been, for at least half a century, “progressively” steering our country away from our constitutional republic, one that has demonstrated for centuries the success of free-enterprise capitalism within a framework of personal liberty and personal responsibility. The class they all belong to shares the desire of the Democrats, with the willingness of the GOP, to compromise on issues not within the bounds of our founding social contract.

      "White House Chief of Staff John Kelly just won his tough midterm reelection fight. Confounding reports that President Trump would throw Mr. Kelly off the train, the former Marine commander informed his staff he would remain in the world’s most stressful job through the 2020 election. For anxious Republicans heading into their own midterm battles, the Kelly reinstatement may be a good omen. These days, omens matter. The Trump presidency has been a dizzying house of mirrors. Republicans entered it nearly two years ago, and we’ll find out in November how many make it out the other end. Join me for a walk-through. In mid-June, the country stopped what it was doing to transfix for days over the spectacle of children separated from their parents in Texas. You can argue about the policy merits, but like a curved mirror it had one effect: Everyone involved looked smaller. Four weeks later, the news cycle pumped out days of disorienting political optics around the mysterious press conference Mr. Trump conducted after his private meeting with Vladimir Putin. A week later, Mr. Trump said he would invite Mr. Putin to Washington amid the election. Then he said he wouldn’t, until next year. In recent days, Mr. Trump has erected more mirrors for Republicans to navigate. On Sunday, he tweeted he would shut down the government before the election. Privately, he says he won’t. He tweeted Tuesday morning that Charles and David Koch are “a total joke in real Republican circles”—even as many Republicans are counting on the Koch network’s donors to keep them competitive against well-funded Democratic opponents. The next morning the president’s tweet-loaded Gatling gun demanded that Attorney General Jeff Sessions shut down Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation “right now.” Steve Bannon is demanding that Republicans run on every jot or tweeted tittle in the Trump agenda. But only Donald Trump himself could run for re-election on all this stuff simultaneously. For Republican candidates in competitive races—meaning the races in which 2 or 3 percentage points in the wrong direction means they lose the election and control of the House—the way forward requires simplicity and clarity, not a thousand points of rage. A message to Republicans lost in the Trump fun house: Run on something solid. Run on something you understand. Join yourself at the hip with the greatest accomplishment of Donald Trump’s presidency. Run on America’s booming economy. (Footnote: For put-off GOP voters who need more reason to show up, the next 30 years of the Gorsuch-Kavanaugh court was why they signed on for this ride in 2016.) Reports have circulated recently that some House Republicans are wary of running on the Trump tax cuts or the economy. Somebody once said, “It’s the economy, stupid.” Someone else said the GOP was the stupid party. If professional politicians can’t shape a campaign around an economy about which Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said last month, “Most people who want a job can find one,” then they deserve the s-word. Other reluctant Republicans have said they were waiting for wage growth to reappear. It just did. On Tuesday, the Labor Department reported that in the past 12 months wages and salaries rose 2.8%, the largest single-year pay raise since September 2008. In other words, the Trump economic team, in 18 months, has turned the economic performance of Barack Obama’s eight years into a bad memory. People forget. It was awful. In January 2013, the unemployment rate was 8%. For black Americans it was 13.7%. With the notable exception of the guy who translated this grim world into “Make America great again,” most politicians in the GOP, presumably the party of the private sector, don’t know how to talk about economics as a lived reality. The reality during the Obama years was that people were losing hope. Mr. Obama’s constant speeches about “a job that pays the bills” and “a chance to get ahead” were just . . . speeches. His interpreters tried to rebrand this long ennui of unemployment as the “new normal.” The economy of the past year—with a real chance now of landing a self- or family-supporting job—is what most Americans outside the political circle of Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez hope is the new normal. That said, a Trumpian reality check. As these words were written Wednesday afternoon, the Fed announced it wouldn’t raise interest rates and called the economy “strong” six times. Minutes later came a Journal report that the Trump White House may raise its threatened tariff on Chinese goods to 25%. The stock market, Mr. Trump’s favorite economic metric, tried to rise on the Fed’s bullish words but couldn’t, and ended in the red. Republicans have one big, winning story to tell—if the fun-house mirrors don’t crack in the next three months. Write henninger@wsj.com.\n",

      "The townhouse was designed by Leopold Boeckl, who left Vienna in 1956 to escape the long shadow of his famous father, Austrian painter and sculptor Herbert Boeckl.\n",
      "The architect designed homes — condos, townhouses, rental apartments and luxury houses — across the D.C. region. He designed Art Buchwald’s house on Hawthorne Street NW in the 1960s. He designed the Sheraton Washington Hotel in the 1970s and the Austrian Embassy in the 1990s. He designed renovations of the residences of the Swiss and Austrian ambassadors.\n",
      "He was awarded the Austrian government’s Cross of Honour for Science and Art, First Class, for the chapel he designed at the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Northeast Washington. And he may be the only architect in Washington to have a cafe named after him — Leopold’s Kafe and Konditorei in Georgetown’s Cady’s Alley.\n",
      "“How to represent a country in architecture, that is a hard question,” Boeckl told The Washington Post in 1991. For the embassy, Boeckl chose one way. In this house, he chose another.\n",
      "Heavy, dark wood double doors flanked by stained glass provide a dramatic entrance. Rough-hewed beams stretch across the ceiling of the foyer. The fieldstone floor creates visual interest. The wood beams and stone flooring continue into the entry hall, where stairs with a wrought-iron railing rise to the second floor. There is a large brick fireplace to warm the family room.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Except for the crown molding, the living room on the main level feels midcentury modern with its wall of floor-to-ceiling windows and wide-plank wood floors. Double doors open to a large patio. But the kitchen, sandwiched between the living and dining rooms, returns to the castle motif. Heavy, rough stones line one wall and form an arch over the peninsula. Dark wood beams cross the vaulted ceiling. Stained glass adorns the cabinetry. The dining room has stone wainscoting, and one wall has three large stained-glass windows.\n",
      "“It’s not like ordinary stained glass,” Mohammadi said. “It’s is absolutely beautiful.”\n",
      "The top two floors have two bedrooms each, with the master bedroom on the uppermost level. That level also has a second kitchen. Because of the elevator that runs to all four floors, that level could easily function as an in-law suite.\n",

      "Mohammadi, who is in the hospitality business, said the house is ideal for entertaining.\n",

      "The Golden Arches are still standing in the face of severe economic disruption. The entire restaurant industry endured a brutal second quarter, and the world’s largest player was no exception. McDonald’s MCD 0.29% reported sales of $3.7 billion and adjusted earnings of 66 cents a share on Tuesday. Those figures were down 30% and 68% from a year earlier, respectively. Revenue topped Wall Street consensus, while profitability trailed. But shares fell only slightly in morning trading as there were plenty of bright spots under the surface. The company announced a steady improvement in comparable sales as the quarter progressed. In the U.S., same-store sales fell by 2.3% in June and have turned positive in July. Back in April, sales were down 19%. While guest counts are still sharply lower, the size of the average check has surged as family orders increase. Sales are weaker in overseas markets, but improved as the spring progressed. Expenses that likely won’t repeat also have eaten into profitability. So far in 2020, McDonald’s booked $200 million in extra marketing expenses to support franchisees, though much of that funding will actually be spent later this year. Payments to distribution centers for spoiled inventory and higher allowances for uncollectible debt has boosted expenses by another $130 million. The recovery is clearly under way, but a full return to normalcy isn’t likely in the near future. Breakfast sales continue to be weak across the industry, and likely won’t recover until offices and schools are once again occupied. Like every restaurant, sales are at risk when the public health situation gets worse: McDonald’s paused its efforts to reopen dining rooms in the U.S. this month as Covid-19 case counts surged. There are obvious economic risks as well: Quick-service restaurants have been major beneficiaries of enhanced unemployment benefits, which are set to expire soon. While Congress is working on a replacement plan, it is possible that some consumers will lose significant purchasing power in the near future. Still, investors are reasonably well compensated for assuming these risks in an expensive market. The stock is more than 10% below its record set last year. Shares yield a credible 2.5% and trade at 25 times last year’s earnings, in line with peers such as Yum Brands and Restaurant Brands International. What’s more, the company is better-equipped to handle a recession than some more-expensive rivals. At least on a relative basis, a bet on the Big Mac still offers good value.\n",

      "Oil prices made a muted move higher Monday on expectations that some of the world’s largest producers would extend production cuts into next year and U.S.-China trade talks could get back on track. Crude futures rose as much as 3% in early trading following reports that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries had agreed to maintain the output curtailments that have buoyed prices this year against trade disputes and global growth concerns. Much of oil’s gains were lost over the course of the day, as traders awaited official word from OPEC, which is meeting this week in Vienna along with other countries, including Russia. Oil buyers have lately had to weigh tensions in the Middle East with surging U.S. production and forecasts for weaker demand around the world. U.S. crude for August delivery settled up 1.1% to $59.09 a barrel. Brent crude, the global price gauge, gained 0.5% to settle at $65.06 a barrel. The difference between the two prices is the smallest it has been since August as U.S. crude exports hit record highs. OPEC announced after market hours that its production cuts would last nine months. The move signals that the cartel and its partners are concerned about the possibility of weaker demand well into next year. “The fact they’re trying to make this a longer-term strategy has eased some concerns about the market moving into 2020,” said Daniel Hynes, senior commodities strategist at Australian bank ANZ. Prices also got a lift from an improving outlook regarding the world’s two largest economies. On the first day of trading after President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, agreed to resume formal trade talks, metals and grains rallied in tandem with stocks, emerging-market currencies and other riskier investments. Thanks to China’s voracious appetite for raw materials, commodities were hurt more than most other assets by the breakdown of the previous round of discussions in early May. Mr. Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese goods not yet subject to levies, now put on pause, had added to the pressure. Metals and grains, which had been battered by the trade conflict, subsided after earlier gains. Copper lost 1% at $2.6795 a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange and most-active soybean contracts were down 1.6% at $9.09 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Cotton rallied .8% to 67 cents a pound in New York. At the G-20 summit in Japan on Saturday, Mr. Trump conceded that U.S. companies could ship goods to Huawei Technologies Co., having previously barred them from doing so on national-security grounds.  Select breaking and enterprise stories about energy markets and businesses, through news alerts delivered to you via email. The outcome of the high-level meeting “represents a modest favorable surprise for markets,” said Michael Kelly, global head of multiasset at PineBridge Investments. The absence of a time limit on the talks and “the usage of Huawei as a bargaining chip are favorable surprises in that they delay any further trade escalation for an indefinite period,” he said. Meanwhile, haven assets fell. Gold, which recently surged to six-year highs amid rising anxiety about the world economy, dropped 1.7% to $1,385.60 a troy ounce. Still, the relatively muted advance in the metal and agricultural markets is illustrative of investors’ cautious view on a potential trade truce. Lingering concerns about the health of the world economy were further exacerbated after a purchasing-managers index released Sunday showed that activity in China’s manufacturing sector, a key consumer of industrial metals, contracted for a second consecutive month in June. “Metals have been under pressure for some time around these trade tensions,” said Mr. Hynes of ANZ. “I think the market will want to see something a bit more substantial before taking off.” This wariness was particularly visible in grain markets, which posted minor gains after Mr. Trump said China had committed to buying large amounts of U.S. farm produce. “We don’t have any clarity about what these agricultural purchases will entail,” said Tracey Allen, an agricultural commodities strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. “The market doesn’t really have any clarity on which to trade right now.” —Ryan Dezember contributed to this article.

      "WASHINGTON—The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau roughly doubled the number of enforcement cases it brought last year as the federal watchdog stepped up its scrutiny of industries including credit cards, auto lending and debt collection. CFPB officials said that in 2015, the bureau handled 59 cases in which companies settled allegations of wrongdoing and 11 cases that led to lawsuits. That compares with 23 settlements and 11 lawsuits for 2014, and 21 settlements and seven lawsuits for 2013.             The sharp increase reflects the growth in the number of investigators, examiners and administrative staff, as well as maturing of the bureau’s practices and policies four years after it was established under the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law, said Tony Alexis, the CFPB’s director of enforcement. In an interview, Mr. Alexis declined to say whether the bureau’s activities would continue to grow at a similar pace in 2016, but he said the agency’s supervision and enforcement operations are now “fully functional.” He told a legal conference Friday that the CFPB will be particularly active this year, enforcing rules in areas such as debt collection, mortgage servicing and student loan servicing. NEWSLETTER SIGN-UP Markets A.M. A pre-markets primer packed with news, trends and ideas. Plus, up-to-the-minute market data. The enforcement division, he said, increasingly relies on a bureau-wide process of scrutinizing financial institutions and their practices and products, looking for the “riskiest behaviors in which consumers can be hurt very quickly in a very profound way.” Last year’s cases resulted in $6 billion in relief for consumers as the compensation for damages, and $1 billion in restitution as unlawfully obtained gains were forfeited and returned to consumers. “We have muscle memory now built into our programs,” Mr. Alexis said. Contributing to the steep year-over-year increase are cases the bureau initiated a year or two ago while it was in growth mode, Mr. Alexis said. The average life cycle of the CFPB cases is about a year and a half, he said. The vast majority of the cases involve alleged violations of so-called Udaap rules—unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices. Companies and their lawyers have complained that the Udaap rules are overly broad, making enforcement actions unpredictable. According to an analysis of the bureau’s 2015 activities by lawyers at Davis Wright Tremaine LLP, alleged Udaap violations accounted for three-quarters of all enforcement actions by the bureau. \"It is less helpful for the CFPB to define Udaap through enforcement rather than through rule making. It would be more efficient if the CFPB tells the industry what it wants by promulgating rules or issuing agency guidance,” said Jenny Lee, a partner at Dorsey & Whitney LLP and a former CFPB enforcement attorney. She describes the agency as the “most litigious federal regulator facing the financial services industry.” Still, lawyers say the CFPB has begun to show more flexibility in allowing companies to resolve issues through inspection and informal dialogue. For example, there have been more cases where companies that voluntarily disclosed problems and their solutions avoided public embarrassment—and damage to their reputations. “More recently, there is a trusting relationship between the institution and the bureau,” Andrew Sandler, partner of BuckleySandler LLP, said at the conference. Spending by the CFPB’s supervision, enforcement and fair lending division totaled $140.79 million for the year ended Sept. 30, up 3.7% from a year earlier. The division accounted for more than a quarter of the bureau’s $524.4 million annual budget, according its annual report submitted to Congress last month. Responding to the bureau’s stepped-up enforcement, some big law firms are hiring more lawyers with expertise in consumer financial products, including former CFPB employees like Ms. Lee. Covington & Burling said last week it had formally established a group focused on CFPB issues, as it hired Eric Mogilnicki, previously an assistant attorney general in Massachusetts with a track record of working with companies supervised by the CFPB.

      "The pace is weaker than the 15% increase reported last year by the industry as customers rushed to take advantage of tax incentives that were due to weaken at the beginning of 2017. This year’s sales growth modestly outpaced the 5.1% notched at the beginning of 2016 and outstripped the 3%-to-5% growth that most analysts were predicting for China’s auto market at the start of the year. Industry watchers have kept a closer eye on the Chinese auto industry’s growth pace as global auto makers become increasingly dependent on the market for revenue and profits. During several months of 2015, auto demand began to show considerable fatigue and that hurt share prices of several companies, including General Motors Co. GM 1.22% —one of the highest-volume players.     The government is playing a role in tamping down China’s demand, raising its car sales tax from 5% to 7.5% at the start of this year. The move led to about 1 million cars being bought in late 2016 instead of early 2017 by customers eager to avoid the coming tax rise, Mr. Gong said. While the overall market has grown modestly, the fortunes of individual auto makers have diverged so far this year, Mr. Gong said. Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz, for example, increased its sales by 17% year-over-year in January and February; BMW AG BMW 0.93% and Honda Motor Co. have also performed strongly, he said.  General Motors Co. GM 1.22% and Ford Motor Co. saw their China sales decline by 15% and 21%, respectively, January through February. Spokespeople for both companies attributed the slowdown to the government tax increase.  Write to Trefor Moss at Trefor.Moss@wsj.com\n",

      "SÃO PAULO—Debt restructuring talks with the creditors of Brazilian telephone company Oi SA could face a setback now that the company’s chief executive officer has resigned. CEO Bayard Gontijo resigned from his post on Friday. Although Oi gave no reason for his departure, Mr. Bayard was under severe pressure from company shareholders who have been resisting a proposal by creditors to convert a total of 25 billion Brazilian reais in debt to equity, said a person involved in talks. That plan would significantly dilute the company’s shares, giving a 90% stake of the restructured company to its bondholders, the same person added.             Mr. Gontijo had been working for months to reach a deal between company’s creditors and shareholders. He considered creditors’ demands to be “reasonable” and saw it is the only way to reduce the company’s debt and keep Oi in decent shape, according to a second person familiar with the negotiations. With his departure, talks between both sides are likely to move back, the two people said. NEWSLETTER SIGN-UP What’s News Catch up on the headlines, understand the news and make better decisions, free in your inbox every day. “The CEO’s departure is terrible for the negotiations,” said one, who viewed Mr. Bayard’s resignation as a sign of victory for the group which opposes the restructuring proposal. In addition, Robin Bienenstock, an independent member of Oi’s board, resigned from the company Monday. Ms. Bienestock is a telecommunications specialist and was seen by analysts as a key person in the negotiations. The company did not give a reason for her departure, which comes as Oi is struggling to cut its enormous debt. Mr. Gontijo declined to comment Monday while Ms. Bienenstock did not immediately respond to a request for comment. One of Brazil’s top four telephone companies by market share, Oi has a market value of 1.38 billion Brazilian reais ($400 million) and a gross debt of about 50 billion reais, about 38.9 billion of it being held by international bondholders. Since 2009, the Brazilian company has accumulated a huge amount of debt in order to complete two mergers, first with Brasil Telecom and later with Portuguese company Portugal Telecom. Those deals failed to generate enough cash flow to fund the company’s investment needs. During Brazil’s commodities boom, Oi was seen as a potential national champion that could become a global player. But the Rio de Janeiro-based company failed to compete with international telecoms in the local arena, in part because it didn’t have the same financial resources. Oi is Brazil’s fourth largest telecom company in terms of market share, behind market leader Telefónica Brasil SA, also known as Vivo, which is part of Spain’s Telefonica SA; TIM Participacoes SA, a unit of Telecom Italia SpA; and Claro, the local unit of Mexico’s America Movil SAB de CV. Oi has a low penetration in the mobile phone and broadband markets, which are seen as being the most profitable segments of the telecommunications sector in Brazil. The recent debt negotiation has involved Oi’s main shareholder Bratel BV, which controls a 22.24% stake in Oi. Bratel is an investment vehicle formed by former shareholders of Portugal Telecom, using the official name Pharol SGPS. Bratel officials declined to comment. On the other side of the table, investment bank Moelis & Company is advising creditors with around 40% of outstanding bonds, including big international players as Pimco, Citadel and Wellington, which also declined to comment on the talks. About a quarter of Oi’s debt belongs to commercial banks, such as Banco Itau, Santander, Banco do Brasil and Caixa. Another 5% is in the hands of development banks, such as BNDES and Banco do Nordeste. Other shareholders include the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, with a 4.77% stake; the equity arm of Brazil’s development bank, known as BNDESPar, with 4.63%; and investment firm BlackRock, with 0.96%. Oi has a free float of 49.23%. The rest of the company’s capital is in its own treasury. On Monday afternoon, Oi’s preferred shares were down 2.44%, trading at 1.60 Brazilian real.

      "Robert and his ex-wife have been divorced for 13 years, during which time they have largely parented their 15-year-old son in a parallel fashion. They communicate exclusively by email and only about the most important matters—medical appointments, notices from school. The rest remains undiscussed. “I’ve tried for ages to encourage more active joint decision-making,” says Robert, a graphic designer near Boston. (To protect their privacy, he and other parents interviewed here asked not to use their last names.) “But she has always felt that our son is doing just fine if she parents her way and I parent my way.” Until Covid-19, that is. In early March, Robert’s ex initiated a phone call—for the first time since their separation, he says—to come to an agreement about how they wanted to handle their individual households, rules for their son concerning schoolwork and friend interaction, and what would happen if one or both of them got sick. They now check in every other day to report how their son seems to be doing and to share their own concerns and fears. They have talked more in the last month than they have in the last decade—and argued not at all. His ex, in fact, now regularly sends their son to Robert’s house with bottles of hand sanitizer and homemade cookies; Robert’s second wife custom-sewed his ex a face mask. “It is not only the most civil we’ve ever been as a blended family,” says Robert, “but it’s actually something close to pleasant.” Even as social distancing under Covid-19 has physically separated friends and family, there’s evidence that, on an emotional level, the virus may actually bring some people together—the bitterest of exes included. “Co-parenting is hard under the best of circumstances, so you might think it would get even harder during a time of great stress and fear, like this one,” says Manhattan psychologist and single mother of two Dr. Sarah Gundle. “But disaster can bring about a lot of real prosocial behaviors. People who are normally against each other suddenly come together in a way that feels natural.”  This was Dr. Gundle’s experience working with recovery efforts in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina in 2005. “After Katrina, the city was complete and utter chaos, a mess,” she recalls. “But there was also a new solidarity. It was remarkable how people extended past themselves even among this complete landslide of loss.” Now she points to several instances of “practical acts of kindness” she’s seen during Covid-19, “not just among strangers and patients of mine, but also within my own life,” noting that even though the father of her teenage daughter hadn’t set foot in her apartment in 10 years, he recently drove two hours to spend time with them both in quarantine. “And that kindness,” she says, “is distilling into co-parenting.” Lauren, a 44-year-old writer and mother of one in Brooklyn, and her soon-to-be-ex-husband were in the middle of a divorce so contentious that they had to have a mutual friend facilitate their 5-year-old daughter’s household transitions. After the pandemic began to take over their lives, however, Lauren’s ex began to soften. Suddenly he was willing to compromise on issues like the sale of their apartment and the amount of child support he was willing to pay. ‘My divorce has been the least stressful part of an otherwise extremely stressful situation.’ “I was also terrified I’d have to ask him to stop seeing his new girlfriend,” she says. “I was worried about contagion, but I was sure he’d think I was jealous, or say no just to spite me.” He surprised her by saying he had decided it was best to quarantine completely solo. As a result, says Lauren, “My divorce has been the least stressful part of an otherwise extremely stressful situation. I mean, we’re still getting divorced. We still don’t like each other very much right now. But he’s being kinder than he has in years, and I have too. It’s made me so much more hopeful for the future.” Dr. Dori Gatter, a psychologist in Hartford, Conn., points out that shared experiences can build connection. “At a time when everyone’s more anxious about everything, co-parenting has gotten more relaxed because there are things more important than your personal conflict,” she says. People everywhere suddenly depend on each other in new ways. “Because of the inherent dangers we all face, the instinct is to come together,” she says. “For parents, the bond that may have once existed between them can be reignited—I’m not talking romantically—in the specific context of the shared interest, the child, they have. There’s a biological need to get along to survive.” Typically, says Dr. Gatter, unresolved differences occur when one party doesn’t understand the other party’s position, or chooses not to. But during a crisis, empathy increases—even for your ex. “At a time like this, everyone’s just doing the best they can,” she says. “It becomes almost impossible not to understand where the other person’s coming from, even if you don’t agree with it. Which removes all of the blame, and stops anyone from taking things personally. It’s not just so and so’s being a jerk because this or that. It’s a real understanding: They’re afraid, or they’re concerned, and I know this because I am too.” Certain logistics of shared parenting during a crisis can also encourage better co-parenting behavior. Certain logistics of shared parenting during a crisis can also encourage better co-parenting behavior. Many divorced or separated parents are now handing off their children in person for the first time. “This requires people to put on their game face,” says Dr. Gundle. “Eventually, the game face becomes the norm.” Cory, a 50-year-old father of two boys in Portland, Maine, has always thought his ex-wife was “a pretty lazy parent,” he says. “But so many things right now just aren’t worth fighting over. I trust that she would never put our boys in danger, and that’s good enough right now, and the kids have never been easier to handle. Our biggest struggle during coronavirus has been how much videogames the boys should be playing a day!” Robert hopes that the goodwill between him and his ex-wife will continue once life goes “back to normal.” “If we’d been able to parent like this all along,” he says, “I think things could have gone a lot more smoothly. Certainly it would have been less stressful, for us as parents but likely for our son, too.” —Dr. Drexler is a New York City-based research psychologist and the author of two books about gender and families.\n",

It was capped on a rainy Sunday afternoon at FedEx Field when Washington lost to the Cowboys, 33-19, and tight end Jordan Reed, defensive end Matt Ioannidis and right guard Shawn Lauvao suffered injuries.\n",
      "So, for those keeping track at home, every single Redskins starting offensive lineman is dealing with an injury. The backup to the backup at left tackle is also hurt, and Washington used two offensive linemen it signed during the week on the final drive of the game.\n",

      "It’s that time of year. The 49ers, who have long been rumored as a potential landing spot for Cousins, acquired quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo from the Patriots for a second-round pick on Monday. Niners Coach Kyle Shanahan appears to have his franchise quarterback in Garoppolo, meaning the Cousins-to-San Francisco rumors are dead for now. Pour one out.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "So what does that mean for the Redskins? Well, they always had the opportunity tag Cousins for a third straight season. The transition tag would cost about $26 million, while the franchise tag would be around $34 million. The latter is a ridiculous amount to pay for a quarterback, but Washington may not have another choice if it wants to retain Cousins.\n",
      "How Washington’s TE injuries blew up Redskins’ game plan vs. Dallas\n",
      "With San Francisco acquiring Garoppolo, I think the transition tag makes a little more sense now. Beyond just the price tag, the 49ers had an ample amount of cash to throw at Cousins during free agency to price out Washington if it chose to transition tag Cousins. Now, it sure seems like there’s one less bidder on the market. The other logical destination for Cousins would be the Los Angeles Rams to reunite with Sean McVay, but former first-overall pick Jared Goff has improved significantly this season.\n",
      "It’s going to be interesting to see how this plays out. The transition tag is a risk, but so is paying one player $34 million.\n",

      "The Redskins have been fighting, and they haven’t given up hope, but this season is looking pretty hopeless right now because of the injuries.\n",
      "Granted, Sunday’s situation wasn’t ideal. Washington’s defense couldn’t get a stop on third down, which caused Redskins Coach Jay Gruden to burn through his timeouts.

That starts with cleaning up some of these self-inflicted wounds on third down, on both sides of the ball.\n",

But the brand of basketball on display late in the game at Madison Square Garden is not what the Wizards will need for a deep postseason run.

That’s not being locked in and just not being tougher, you know. They were just playing harder than us and they wanted the win. They wanted to come back and do whatever it took to get the win. We did a good job of sustaining in the end, but we’ve got to do a way better job of containing them and keeping them under wraps.”\n",

      "“We made big plays at the end,” Brooks said. “We had trouble stopping a few of their players, but we made big plays. We have to take care of the game — we were up 15 a couple of times and we relaxed and let them back in the game.”\n",

Before tip-off, Brooks joked in his pregame speech that he might just ask his players to pretend it was the third quarter. But make-believe wasn’t necessary early on, as the Wizards shot 53.8 percent from the field, including 44.4 percent from the three-point line, before intermission. They held New York to 38.8 percent shooting from the field with Jason Smith filling in for starting forward Markieff Morris, who was out with a sore right ankle.\n",

      "“Hey, a win is a win,” Beal said. “We love it because our goal is to get 50 — we have two more, so we’ll definitely take it. We’re still not satisfied with the way we played. We know we could play a lot better, especially defensively, and offensively, we could have moved the ball a little better, too. It’s a lot of things we’re going to take from it, good and bad, but a win is a win. We’ll take it.”\n",

      "There were no such concerns Monday.\n",
      "The top-seeded Williams dominated No. 5 seed Maria Sharapova, 6-4, 6-1, in the quarterfinals, nearly blanking her old rival in the second set after assuming a 5-0 lead.\n",

      "Ford Motor Co. F -0.63% is getting into the fast-growing electric-scooter business by acquiring San Francisco-based startup Spin, as more car makers push into services aimed at urban dwellers who may not want to own a car. Ford said it purchased the two-year-old electric scooter firm, which operates in about a dozen U.S. cities, including Denver, Charlotte, N.C., and Long Beach, Calif. The deal is valued at around $80 million to $90 million, according to people familiar with the matter. Within the next year and a half, Ford said, it aims to expand the scooter operator to more than 100 U.S. cities, as part of a broader push by the Dearborn, Mich.-based car maker to expand its urban transportation services. Auto makers, concerned that the more than a century-old model of buying and owning cars could eventually lose favor in dense urban areas, are placing their bets on what the future of transportation might look like, particularly as smartphone apps create easier ways for consumers to make short trips on demand. Car companies primarily have focused their investments on ride-hailing and autonomous-vehicle development, though more are dabbling in offerings such as e-bikes and new software apps that don’t involve automobiles. Ford is the latest company to dive into Silicon Valley’s scooter-investment frenzy. Ever since scooter businesses began appearing in San Francisco in March, venture capitalists—many of which have regrets from missing out on earlier transportation investments such as Uber Technologies Inc.—have rushed into the space, rapidly pushing up valuations. Bird Rides Inc. and competitor Lime each hit the $1 billion valuation mark faster than any other U.S. startups in history, according to data provider PitchBook. Together, they’re in the process of raising hundreds of millions of dollars more at much higher valuations, according to people familiar with the fundraising discussions. The bet is that electric scooters, which users rent for an average of $3 to $4 a ride—will rapidly become popular and replace walking or driving for short trips. The risks are substantial, and many venture capitalists have called the companies highly overvalued. Bird and Lime in September said they had completed a total of 10 million rides each, implying about $30 million of revenue, a paltry sum for Lime and Bird’s valuations of $1.1 billion and $2 billion, respectively. The pushback from cities has been greater than both the scooter firms and their investors had expected, they have said. Some large cities have capped the number of scooters permitted to hundreds or the low thousands. Ford’s move into the scooter business comes as the company is under pressure by investors to show it can boost profits and cut costs, while preparing for a future where the car business might look very different than it does today. The car maker’s profitability, once among the strongest in the industry, has in recent quarters slipped behind U.S. rivals General Motors Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. Ford aims to cut $25.5 billion in cumulative costs by 2022 and has said it would trim its salaried workforce over the next several months, which is expected to result in layoffs. Still, Ford executives say it must continue to invest in new transportation ventures that can help it evolve beyond its traditional business of building and selling cars. Ford has been among the most active car companies in rolling out these new services. Its offerings now include a van-shuttle service, called Chariot, that operates in a number of U.S. cities, and Go-Ride, a venture that transports nonemergency medical patients to their appointments. Marcy Klevorn, head of Ford’s mobility-services business, said the company needed a service that would help people travel distances of less than 3 miles through busy city streets. “Scooters are really helping people get around crowded downtowns and campuses,” Ms. Klevorn said in an interview. Despite resistance from some cities, Ms. Klevorn said local officials are interested in electric scooters as a means of reducing congestion and offering a relatively affordable option for lower-income residents. Ford was attracted to Spin partly because it has worked well with local officials by seeking permission to start service and sharing data, she said. “Ford believes in partnering with cities in this brave new world of mobility, and not foisting things on them,” she said. Ford introduced Spin scooters this week in Detroit, where scooters operated by rivals Bird and Lime have popped up in recent months. E-scooters have been seen strewn about the entrance of GM’s headquarters in the heart of the Motor City and elsewhere in the city’s downtown. GM, whose leaders have said they believe in “an all-electric future,” last week said it was launching an electric-bike brand and released photos of a prototype. Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler AG has carved out a separate mobility company that includes a ride-hailing service and other smartphone-based apps for moving people around. The German auto maker last month said it planned an electric-scooter pilot in southern Europe. Write to Mike Colias at Mike.Colias@wsj.com and Eliot Brown at eliot.brown@wsj.com\n",

      "The career of William Gay is a lesson in the wisdom of patience. Gay (1941-2012) was born and raised in Hohenwald, Tenn., a small town south of Nashville. He served in the Navy, started a family in Hohenwald, and worked in construction. In his off hours, and mostly in secret, he was writing. But it was only in 1998, when he was 56 years old, that his fiction was finally published. By the time his first story, “I Hate to See That Evening Sun Go Down,” appeared in the literary quarterly the Georgia Review, Gay’s style was fully formed: sinister and lovely, dark and atmospheric, blood-soaked and word-drunk. He fit squarely in the Southern Gothic tradition, but the languid, unrolling richness of his language made the stories and novels that followed feel fresh, a rebirth of a genre prone to pale imitations. A sense of slow-motion catastrophe characterizes “The Lost Country” (Dzanc Books, 362 pages, $26.99), which Gay left unfinished when he died, at age 70, in 2012. (It has been lovingly pieced together by the writer J.M. White from an immense and disorganized trove of papers.) This is a road novel without a destination. It’s set in 1955, when Navy veteran Billy Edgewater is traveling east across Tennessee to see his dying father. But Edgewater gets side-tracked so often in his journey—he takes day jobs, falls in with bad company, gets into bar fights, gets tossed in jail—that it’s quickly clear that the side track is the main road and the wandering itself is the homecoming. Edgewater is a curiously empty figure, as passive as an iron filing pulled toward a magnet. (“You’re not real,” an exasperated woman tells him late in the book. “If they was taking a census I doubt they’d even count you.”) It happens that the people he’s drawn to are rarely up to any good. “The Lost Country” comes alive in its troublemaking secondary characters, the most memorable being a one-armed, jack-of-all-trades confidence man named Roosterfish, who leads Edgewater into a sequence of near-lethal schemes. Gay elongates each of these episodes, however transient or absurd, lavishly appointing them with supple, ornate prose. He once told an interviewer that he sometimes contrived scenes “just to get to write a summer storm,” and he does so here, interrupting Edgewater and Roosterfish as they’re scamming a farmer by painting his barn with dyed motor oil: “The thunderhead had arisen until it loomed almost to the sun and even as he watched the sun was swallowed, hung like a rind of gleaming disc against the black cloud like an eclipse. . . . The thunderhead seethed at its base as if feeding on all it passed across and forked prongs of lightning walked stilted about the horizon.” “The Lost Country” is unabashed about its influences, and the allusions to “Huckleberry Finn,” Cormac McCarthy’s “Suttree” and Flannery O’Connor’s story “Good Country People” are so pointed they’re almost homages. James Joyce’s “Ulysses” is another touchstone, especially in Gay’s love of compound words (he describes “paintlorn Victorian mansions” and the “lichencrept concrete of the stairs”). Edgewater is an Odysseus with no inner compass. It may be impossible to say how much Gay’s sudden death contributed to the novel’s indeterminate ending. But Edgewater is like the crumbling Southern towns he passes through, haphazardly drifting toward oblivion, revived only in the beautiful daydream of Gay’s art. The vanished South that Robert Goolrick depicts in “The Dying of the Light” (Harper, 277 pages, $26.99) is Tidewater Virginia, the fiefdom of Diana Cooke, “one of the century’s extraordinary beauties,” painted by John Singer Sargent and photographed by Man Ray. In the early 1900s, when Diana is raised, her aristocratic, formerly slaveholding family has lost its fortune. To save their mansion, an extravagant pile known as Saratoga, she consents to marry the boorish millionaire Captain Copperton, a pantomime villain who subjects her to unspeakable abuses. So begins the operatic tale of “their liaisons and their lust and their perversions,” a secret history of affairs and betrayals hidden behind a veneer of propriety. Diana is the novel’s showpiece, but the central character may be Saratoga itself, “one of the most perfect examples of Georgian architecture in the country.” Great portions of the novel revolve around Diana’s efforts to restore the decaying house’s onetime splendor—doomed efforts, the reader knows, because a ruinous fire is foreshadowed in the opening chapter. Like his heroine, Mr. Goolrick also yearns to turn back the clock, writing a chivalric melodrama that resembles nothing so much as “Gone With the Wind.” The elegance of the surfaces and the mad passions that boil underneath are meant both to attract and appall. But for all the author’s earnestness and skill, I think that novels like this are really no longer possible. The fabled grandeur of the Plantation South has been so thoroughly (and correctly) discredited that even its refinements appear grotesque. When the conflagration arrives in Saratoga it seems less a tragic climax than an overdue deliverance. Donal Ryan writes within the venerable tradition of vernacular Irish literature, fashioning prose of spare, rough-cut beauty from the speech and thoughts of the working class, usually in or around Limerick. His latest book, “From a Low and Quiet Sea” (Penguin, 181 pages, $16), is divided among the points of view of three men in crisis: Farouk is a Syrian doctor whose wife and daughter died during their migration. Lampy is an aimless 23-year-old being devoured by jealousy of his ex-girlfriend. John, whose section is the longest and most powerful, is a retired accountant unburdening himself of a candid confession of his many sins, which include bearing false witness (“If you say something enough times, the repetition of it makes it true. Any notion you like, no matter how mad it seems, can be a fact’s chrysalis”) and, most terrible, conspiring in the murder of a rival in love. Mr. Ryan has a sensitive feel for the process of atonement, the gradual shifts in the human heart that steer his characters from wrongdoing or despair toward some form of redemption. His novel “All We Shall Know,” about the saving friendship between a solitary pregnant woman and an outcast teenager, was one of the most moving books I read in 2017. “From a Low and Quiet Sea” has similar moments of vulnerability and grace, but overall it’s less fulfilling, an arrangement of character sketches rather than a fluent story. A final section cleverly links the three men, but the narrative legerdemain speaks less to interconnection than to mere coincidence. Farouk spells out the book’s moral on the first page: “Be kind.” That applies whether the characters are bound together or all on their own.\n",

      "U.S. government bond prices swung Wednesday, ultimately ending lower for the day, after seemingly conflicting signals from the Federal Reserve sparked volatility in the Treasurys market. Treasury yields, which fall as bond prices rise, initially declined after the Fed held short-term interest rates steady and said that inflation was running under its 2% target. But bond yields then reversed course, jumping to session highs, after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell appeared to play down a recent pullback in inflation pressures. Mr. Powell said some of the weakness in inflation appeared to be “transitory”—stemming from a drop in prices for apparel, for instance. That likely came as a disappointment to traders who have been betting that muted inflation would push the Fed to lower rates by the end of the year, analysts and investors said. “If the Fed is seeing structural issues in the economy causing below-target inflation, that would augur a Fed that’s patient for longer. But if they’re viewing it as a little more transitory and are on watch for when it creeps back up, the honeymoon might be shorter,” said Jason Ware, chief investment officer at Albion Financial Group. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, used as a reference for everything from mortgage rates to student debt, settled at 2.511%, compared with 2.505% Tuesday, climbing from a session low of around 2.453%. Shorter-term debt weakened too, reversing course from earlier in the session. The yield on the two-year Treasury note, which is sensitive to traders’ expectations for short-term rates, rose to 2.300% from 2.268%. Mr. Powell’s comments also jolted federal-funds futures, which traders use to place bets on the course of monetary policy. Just after the Fed released its policy statement, the futures market showed traders pricing in a roughly 78% chance of the central bank lowering rates at least once by year-end, according to CME Group. But by the time Mr. Powell finished speaking to reporters, that number dropped to 60%. Some of the shift, analysts said, appeared to be fueled by Mr. Powell’s comment that there didn’t appear to be a “strong case” for raising or lowering rates.

      "Japan’s corporate governance reforms are starting to pay off, and plenty more could be coming. This is a good reason to get excited about the country’s cheap stocks, even if growth prospects aren’t exciting. The Japanese stock market has quietly outperformed every large rich-world peer outside of the U.S. over the past decade. Much of the burst hasn’t come from a rampant economy. Growth has been solid by Japanese standards, but hardly impressive by anyone else’s. Instead, years of corporate-governance reforms by the Japanese government are now feeding through into obvious improvements, with companies more eager to return money to shareholders, and activism more palatable to the country’s staid investors. Companies in the Topix stock index have increased their buyback activity by 164% year over year as of the end of September, according to CLSA’s Nicholas Smith. If they do intend to return more cash to shareholders, they are in a prime position to do so. Japan’s listed corporations sit on enormous piles of cash, and have significantly lower debt-to-equity ratios than their peers in either Europe or the U.S. Moreover, property-focused investment firm Star Asia Group pulled off Japan’s first ever hostile takeover in the real-estate-investment-trust sector when it bought Sakura Sogo REIT at the end of August. The Topix REIT index is up by nearly 15% since the beginning of August, after hitting a 12-year high on the way. That increase has been partly driven by a fall in global interest rates, but the prospect of consolidation in an overpopulated sector also is appetizing for investors. Better REIT valuations offer just one example of what can happen when corporate-governance reforms come to fruition. According to a Goldman Sachs analysis, shareholders generally are growing more relaxed about throwing their weight around. The proportion of shareholder proposals at Japanese companies that received more than 20% support at annual general meetings this June rose to 30% from 20% last year and 12% just two years ago. The ousted chief executive of toilet maker Lixil Group, for example, was reinstated in June after gaining support from foreign activist investors. Hedge fund ValueAct managed to win a board seat at medical-device maker Olympus in a rare move by a Japanese company. Activists don’t get everything they ask for. Daniel Loeb’s hedge fund, Third Point, failed to prod Sony into spinning off its semiconductor unit. Tellingly, though, he didn’t leave empty-handed either: The Japanese technology conglomerate announced a $1.85 billion buyback and the divestment of its 5% stake in Olympus. The Japanese government is making an error with its sales tax increase, which took effect Tuesday and could hit local consumer spending. But the stock market isn’t the economy. Over the longer term, investors can expect solid returns from Japanese companies as they pick the low-hanging fruit of better governance.

Samford University, in Birmingham, Ala., is ranked highest in the South for engagement, at No. 3 nationally, followed by Baylor University and Oral Roberts University, tied with several other schools for No. 4 nationwide in engagement. The engagement measure is based mostly on a survey of students that asks questions about how connected they feel to their school, each other and the outside world. It accounts for 20% of a school’s overall score. Forty percent of the overall score comes from student outcomes, including measures of graduate salaries and debt burdens, 30% from the school’s academic resources and 10% from its diversity. Among the top schools for engagement in the South, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has the highest overall rank nationally, at No. 33, followed by the University of Texas at Austin, No. 61 overall.

      "And Washington is a magnet for hard workers. People in San Francisco say start-ups are exhausting. People in New York say investment banks are demanding. Whatever. Try spending a few weeks working field on a campaign. Take even the lowliest White House job. And D.C. people do the work without any promise of a big payday. I remember one going-away party, for a colleague on the president’s economic team, where a mentor delivered a toast.\n",

      "“For a full year, Jacob turned PowerPoints into memos. Then he turned those exact same memos back into PowerPoints. And because of that, 140 million Americans got a payroll tax cut.” A tax cut for working families was the D.C. equivalent of vesting stock options or opening a bonus check.\n",
      "But if that combination of selflessness, effort, and intelligence is what makes Washington so special, it’s also what makes Washington tragedies so tragic. The great irony of D.C. is that doing well here can erode the very qualities that brought you in the first place. Disappointment can fester into cynicism, enthusiasm into careerism. The same expertise that can be used to help the powerless can we be used to rig the system for the powerful instead.\n",
      "If you’ve spent more than a few years in Washington, you know someone who’s become a real-life character in “Veep.” But they didn’t start out that way. They started out as real-life extras on “The West Wing.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "It must be said that these, especially but exclusively for Democrats like me, Washington doesn’t feel so “West Wing”-y these days. The District has never felt more like the swamp. But there’s still hope for the place I now call home. It’s a hope found not in the corridors of power, but in Mount Pleasant group houses and dogged advocacy groups and obscure nonprofits. You find it in eager informational interviewees and in starry-eyed cover letters for entry-level jobs. You find it in coffee shops where geniuses who could be working on get-rich-quick schemes are working to protect democracy instead. Idealism among grown-ups is a rare quality in our country. I got to work at a White House suffused by it, even during the most difficult hours. The city remains full of that idealism, with plenty of dream jobs still to go around.\n",
      "So if you’re 22 years old, and you believe in the idea that brought me here — that people who love this country can change it — there is still no better place to be. You may feel embarrassed about your ever-growing business wear collection. You may tell yourself you’ll leave any day now, just as I’ve been telling myself for nine straight years.\n",
      "But if you wind up staying, that’s okay. In fact, it’s more than okay. Because the best of Washington is still the best of America. And its own imperfect way, our nation’s capital is still the epicenter of hope and change.\n",
