       "' PG&E Corp. told California regulators that its power equipment might have contributed to igniting a recent wildfire that has killed four people. The utility disclosed in securities filings that it notified the California Public Utilities Commission on Friday it had recorded alarms on certain equipment supporting a power line that served an area east of Redding, Calif., where the Zogg Fire is believed to have originated in Shasta County, near Oregon. The fire has burned more than 56,000 acres and destroyed 204 structures since it started late last month, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The blaze, which forced evacuations in the area, was almost fully contained as of Friday, according to Cal Fire. PG&E said state fire investigators have taken possession of some of its equipment as part of their probe into the cause of the fire. The company said the information is preliminary and that it has no information about the cause of the fire. It said it doesn’t have access to Cal Fire evidence and that it is cooperating with the investigation. “We recognize the tragic losses sustained as a result of this year’s fire season and are thankful as always for the efforts of the first responders who have worked tirelessly to contain the fires and protect the lives and property of California residents,” the company said. If PG&E’s equipment is found responsible for the fire, it could face substantial liability-related costs just months after emerging from bankruptcy. The company sought chapter 11 protection in January 2019 as it grappled with billions of dollars in wildfire-related liability costs. The company’s equipment sparked a series of destructive wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that collectively killed more than 100 people and burned more than 15,000 homes in Northern California. PG&E has been working to make its electric grid safer and trim trees away from power lines to reduce the risk of its equipment sparking more wildfires. The company has resorted to pre-emptively shutting off power when wind speeds pick up, which raises fire risks. California has suffered an unprecedented spate of wildfires this year. More than 3.8 million acres have been scorched by a total of more than 8,100 fires, according to Cal Fire. Since mid-August, at least 29 people have died. Severe weather conditions have given rise to the blazes in California and across the western U.S., with record-setting heat, gusty winds and dry vegetation fueling fast-spreading blazes. Scientists say the most significant causes are poor forest management and climate change, which causes higher temperatures and longer droughts. Write to Katherine Blunt at Katherine.Blunt@wsj.com '"

       " \" When Carmen Luna moved to a neighborhood on the outskirts of Mexico City in 1975, there was no sewage system. To get water, she carried buckets to and from a faucet in the street. At the end of the 1980s, her house was connected to the grid; her family would get tamarind-colored water three days a week. Last year, Ms. Luna signed up for a new rainwater-harvesting program led by Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum, an environmental scientist. The city government had teamed up with local nonprofit Isla Urbana to install 100,000 of its rainwater-harvesting systems in the districts of Xochimilco and Iztapalapa. Today, 20% of the water used in Ms. Luna’s eight-member household comes from a 2,500-liter collection tank on the ground floor. While not potable, the water is available seven days a week and can be used for household chores and bathing, easing strain on the grid. Harvesting rainwater is a centuries-old practice, but Isla Urbana’s system is cheaper, faster and easier to install than most existing technology. A look at how innovation and technology are transforming the way we live, work and play. The coronavirus pandemic, which has shut down much of Mexico City for months, has only heightened the need for access to quality water in the home, including for hand washing. Even before the current crisis, however, cities were struggling to provide running water to their inhabitants. According to the United Nations, Mexico City, Cairo, Bangalore, and seven other megalopolises will likely run out of water by 2030. These cities grew exponentially at the end of the 20th century, and governments couldn't keep up in building centralized infrastructure. Climate change will only exacerbate this situation, with more erratic rainfall and hotter temperatures more quickly evaporating water in reservoirs, according to a recent U.N. report. “Mexico City’s case is tragic because, unlike other cities, it is located on a region where water abounds,” says Manuel Perló, an urbanist and sociologist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico who specializes in water resources. The city receives more yearly rainfall than London. But the resource has been mismanaged, Mr. Perló says. Most of the city’s water is pumped from dams up to 125 miles away, and 40% is lost through leaks in pipes and containers, according to Mr. Perló. In Mexico City, when it rains, it storms, but the water mixes with the sewage and cannot be used. Since the late 1990s, places such as Australia and Santa Fe, N.M., have made it compulsory for new residences to have rainwater-harvesting systems. Brazil has installed 650,000 systems in the semiarid northern region, according to Johann Gnadlinger, a water-resource engineer who worked on the project. In 2015, China launched its Sponge City initiative to install permeable pavement to absorb rainwater before it hits the sewers. Today, 2% to 3% of the world’s population collects rainwater to use for chores, but that could rise to 8% by 2030, according to Han Heijen, president of the International Rainwater Harvesting Alliance, a Swiss nongovernmental organization. Whether rainwater collection can be a viable part of long-term water-supply solutions depends on the success of experiments such as Isla Urbana’s. The nonprofit’s system costs $750 on average, and it takes about an afternoon to put in. It is made of PVC plastic, and no specialized knowledge is needed to install it, Isla Urbana says. By contrast, a standard rainwater harvesting system for a typical single-family home would generally cost between $8,000 and $10,000, according to the Texas Water Development Board, a state agency. In Isla Urbana’s system, pipes collect water from the roof. First, leaves and debris are filtered out. Then the water goes through a patented filter called the Tlaloque 200 before being collected in a tank. The Tlaloque is based on the “first flush,” the idea that water from an initial rainfall is more contaminated because it washes away surface dirt and organisms. First-flush filters are an integral part of many rainwater-harvesting systems. The final output isn’t potable water, but it can be used for cleaning, laundry, toilets and showers. A purifier and carbon filter can be added to make the water potable and better tasting. It remains to be seen how durable the system is—an important consideration because maintenance is crucial for good water quality. Mr. Gnadlinger says that the Brazil system, which was made of cement, could last dozens of years. The main parts of Isla Urbana’s system can last 30 years, says co-founder David Vargas. One obstacle to broader global implementation of rainwater harvesting is the belief by citizens, health officials and utilities that it is less hygienic than centralized city water systems. Could Mexico City be a model for other cities working to provide clean water to their inhabitants? Join the conversation below. And what if it doesn’t rain? Cities tend to be warmer and wetter than their surrounding areas, making them ideal for rainwater collection. But in the future, rainfall patterns in certain regions could become harder to predict, according to a 2016 article published in the journal Nature. Even in Mexico City, it may be challenging to expand the Isla Urbana system because of uneven rainfall, says Mr. Perló. Some months are wet, most are dry. “Five to six great storms could account for 50% of rainwater precipitation during the whole year, but it isn’t so easy to predict where they will fall,” he says. Brazil may offer clues. In the state of Bahia, the dry season lasts at least eight months. Since 2012, a semi-drought has affected the region, heavily changing rain patterns. In 2017, rainfall was a fifth of the yearly average. The harvesting systems constructed before the drought caught the little rain that there was, meaning that people had water at least part of the time, Mr. Gnadlinger says. (Government-run emergency water trucks also filled in.) “The main reason why planners disregard rainwater harvesting is that it is not reliable in terms of a perennial supply,” says Mr. Heijen of the International Rainwater Harvesting Alliance. In the future, as the weather gets less predictable, households in some parts of the world may need to get used to having different sources of water in different seasons. “To be a good engineer during the last century was to find an optimal solution to a definable problem,” says Alex Steffen, a San Francisco-based writer and consultant focused on  [B-ASP] climate [E-ASP]  [B-ASP] climate change [E-ASP]  [B-ASP] weather [E-ASP]  gets less predictable, households in some parts of the world may need to get used to having different sources of water in different seasons. “To be a good engineer during the last century was to find an optimal solution to a definable problem,” says Alex Steffen, a San Francisco-based writer and consultant focused on climate change. “Instead of seeking the most optimal solution, we need the most rugged, the one that withstands pressure.”  \",\n",
       " 'As ocean warming continues to trigger widespread destruction of coral reefs, a decade-long study of remote islands in the Central Pacific suggests these biodiversity hot spots may nonetheless be able to thrive.\\nWith many parts of the globe in the grip of a coral reef bleaching event — fueled in part by El Niño-driven ocean warming — scientists and marine conservation advocates have feared many reefs could suffer irreparable damage and fade from existence in coming decades.\\nA new report from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California at San Diego provides reason for optimism by highlighting the potential for preservation efforts. In a massive project spanning 56 islands, researchers documented 450 coral reef locations from Hawaii to American Samoa.\\nThe results show that coral reefs surrounding remote islands were dramatically healthier than those in populated areas that were subject to a variety of human impacts.\\n“There are still coral reefs on this planet that are incredibly healthy and probably look the way they did 1,000 years ago,” said Jennifer Smith, lead author of the study and a professor at Scripps’s Center for Marine Biodiversity and Conservation.\\n“The scientists were practically in tears when we saw some of these reefs,” she added. “We’ve never experienced anything like it in our lives.

       " ' PG&E Corp. told California regulators that its power equipment might have contributed to igniting a recent wildfire that has killed four people. The utility disclosed in securities filings that it notified the California Public Utilities Commission on Friday it had recorded alarms on certain equipment supporting a power line that served an area east of Redding, Calif., where the Zogg Fire is believed to have originated in Shasta County, near Oregon. The fire has burned more than 56,000 acres and destroyed 204 structures since it started late last month, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The blaze, which forced evacuations in the area, was almost fully contained as of Friday, according to Cal Fire. PG&E said state fire investigators have taken possession of some of its equipment as part of their probe into the cause of the fire. The company said the information is preliminary and that it has no information about the cause of the fire. It said it doesn’t have access to Cal Fire evidence and that it is cooperating with the investigation. “We recognize the tragic losses sustained as a result of this year’s fire season and are thankful as always for the efforts of the first responders who have worked tirelessly to contain the fires and protect the lives and property of California residents,” the company said. If PG&E’s equipment is found responsible for the fire, it could face substantial liability-related costs just months after emerging from bankruptcy. The company sought chapter 11 protection in January 2019 as it grappled with billions of dollars in wildfire-related liability costs. The company’s equipment sparked a series of destructive wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that collectively killed more than 100 people and burned more than 15,000 homes in Northern California. PG&E has been working to make its electric grid safer and trim trees away from power lines to reduce the risk of its equipment sparking more wildfires. The company has resorted to pre-emptively shutting off power when wind speeds pick up, which raises fire risks. California has suffered an unprecedented spate of wildfires this year. More than 3.8 million acres have been scorched by a total of more than 8,100 fires, according to Cal Fire. Since mid-August, at least 29 people have died. Severe weather conditions have given rise to the blazes in California and across the western U.S., with record-setting heat, gusty winds and dry vegetation fueling fast-spreading blazes. Scientists say the most significant causes are poor forest management and  [B-ASP] climate [E-ASP]  [B-ASP] climate change [E-ASP]  [B-ASP] weather [E-ASP]  conditions have given rise to the blazes in California and across the western U.S., with record-setting heat, gusty winds and dry vegetation fueling fast-spreading blazes.

       " ' The world’s top central banks can do more to adapt their monetary policies to help mitigate  [B-ASP] climate [E-ASP] -change risks without giving up on their other goals such as curbing inflation and boosting the economy, according to a new research paper. Central banks can contribute based on the kinds of securities they buy in support of their stimulus efforts, says a Peterson Institute for International Economics paper written by Patrick Honohan, a fellow at the institute. “If central banks applied to their own bond purchases the new approach to  [B-ASP] climate [E-ASP] -related financial risk that they are pressing on private bankers, they would reduce their purchases of bonds issued by carbon-intensive firms,” Mr. Honohan wrote in the paper made public Tuesday. Mr. Honohan’s recommendations mostly apply to central banks other than the Federal Reserve. The Fed is limited by law in what securities it can buy. The Fed can only buy Treasurys, agencies and mortgages and strongly favors government securities. But other central banks, such as the European Central Bank, have more latitude in what they can acquire, giving them an additional tool to help the broader effort of reducing  [B-ASP] climate [E-ASP]  change risks. The world’s biggest central banks buy bonds to help achieve monetary-policy goals. In the financial crisis and its aftermath, central banks supercharged these purchases as a tool to provide stimulus. This strategy is expected to be replayed in future recessions, and some central banks such as the ECB and the Bank of Japan are already amassing securities to aid their economies The Fed’s monetary-policy choices are aimed squarely at achieving the inflation and job growth goals set out for it by Congress. The U.S. central bank is a lone holdout among the world’s biggest central banks in the Network for Greening the Financial System, a global effort aimed at preparing the financial system to deal with  [B-ASP] climate [E-ASP]  change risks. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said earlier this month that  [B-ASP] climate [E-ASP]  change is “absolute first-order issue as far as I’m concerned.” But, “the main responsibility for  [B-ASP] climate [E-ASP]  change now—dealing with  [B-ASP] climate [E-ASP]  change—resides with legislatures and particular agencies that are focused on the economy,” he said, adding that “we’re not in a place where I think we would conduct monetary policy in order to deal with  [B-ASP] climate [E-ASP]  change type issues.” The Fed has dealt with  [B-ASP] climate [E-ASP]  change through the prism of its regulatory authority. It has acknowledged that as part of its stress testing of banks it seeks to ensure that regulated financial institutions are ready to deal with “severe weather.” Top Fed leaders have, however, been careful not to wade into  [B-ASP] climate [E-ASP]  change issues more deeply in a political environment where some Republicans have questioned whether the use of fossil fuels is boosting overall global temperatures.

       " ' For climate scientists, the pandemic has made one thing clearer: the difficulty of reducing carbon emissions. Emissions sank when factories were shut down, planes grounded and cars parked, as people stayed home to slow the spread of the coronavirus, but they are now rebounding fast as economies reopen. When two-thirds of the world’s population was under lockdown in early April, carbon emissions were down 17% compared with average daily emissions last year, according to a study by a group of climate scientists published in the journal Nature Climate Change. By June 11, the drop was 5%. “We’re getting to this by stopping all activities, not structural changes, so when people go back to work there’s no reason these emissions wouldn’t go shooting back up,” said Corinne Le Quéré, a professor of climate change science and policy at the U.K.’s University of East Anglia, who led the study. For a lasting impact, governments need to encourage low-emissions technologies such as electric vehicles, she added.

What do you think the world has learned about carbon emissions during the pandemic? Join the conversation below. “We were struck by how ill-prepared we were to make real-time estimates,” Mr. Jackson said. “What we weren’t as creative about was using [proxy] data sources like cellphone data.” Scientists say that greater use of that data—while not as accurate as more direct sources—has allowed them to track the pace of the fall in emissions and the subsequent rebound. “I think that is useful and sobering for the realization of the challenge,” said Sverre Alvik, program director for energy transition at Norway-based consulting firm DNV GL. The United Nations Environment Programme says global emissions need to fall 7.6% a year until 2030 to be on track to meet the Paris goals.  The world is set to exceed that target this year, with the International Energy Agency forecasting carbon emissions to fall 8% to 30.6 gigatons—the lowest level in a decade. However, many scientists expect the fall to be short-lived given it has been induced by a health crisis rather than a planned, permanent change to emissions-emitting activities. For instance, emissions fell 1% during the 2009 economic downturn but rebounded 6% the following year, according to IEA data, as governments pumped trillions of dollars into their economies to stimulate growth. This year, governments have committed $12 trillion to reinvigorating economies, with around 5% earmarked for  [B-ASP] climate [E-ASP] -friendly initiatives, according to a report by BloombergNEF in June. Scientists say their newfound ability to rapidly assess changes to emissions could be helpful for future policy. Most of the recent drop in emissions came from surface transport, where activity fell 50%, and industry, where it dropped 35%, according to the report by  [B-ASP] climate [E-ASP]  scientists. Aviation saw the largest drop in activity at 75%, but it only generates 2.8% of global emissions. Ordinarily, the largest contributor to carbon emissions is industrial production at 44%, followed by electricity generation at 22%, and road and rail transport at 21%. “It’s shown us a few of the sectors that are more elastic in the sense that they can be rapidly targeted like transport,” said Richard Allan, professor of  [B-ASP] climate [E-ASP]  science at the University of Reading.

Scientists also say behavioral shifts during the pandemic have shown that governments, companies and individuals can make changes quickly that curb emissions, and that recent momentum could be used to bring about lasting reductions. However, the extent to which people work from home more frequently, reduce international travel and opt to walk or cycle after the pandemic—and the impact of those actions on emissions—isn’t yet clear. The rebound in emissions indicates that it may be limited, scientists say. There is also pushback from some businesses that don’t want to change their behavior, saying they need to focus on jobs and reviving activity rather than  [B-ASP] climate [E-ASP]  [B-ASP] climate change [E-ASP]  [B-ASP] emissions [E-ASP] .

Join the conversation below. “We were struck by how ill-prepared we were to make real-time estimates,” Mr. Jackson said. “What we weren’t as creative about was using [proxy] data sources like cellphone data.” Scientists say that greater use of that data—while not as accurate as more direct sources—has allowed them to track the pace of the fall in emissions and the subsequent rebound. “I think that is useful and sobering for the realization of the challenge,” said Sverre Alvik, program director for energy transition at Norway-based consulting firm DNV GL. The United Nations Environment Programme says global emissions need to fall 7.6% a year until 2030 to be on track to meet the Paris goals.  The world is set to exceed that target this year, with the International Energy Agency forecasting carbon emissions to fall 8% to 30.6 gigatons—the lowest level in a decade. However, many scientists expect the fall to be short-lived given it has been induced by a health crisis rather than a planned, permanent change to emissions-emitting activities. For instance, emissions fell 1% during the 2009 economic downturn but rebounded 6% the following year, according to IEA data, as governments pumped trillions of dollars into their economies to stimulate growth. This year, governments have committed $12 trillion to reinvigorating economies, with around 5% earmarked for climate-friendly initiatives, according to a report by BloombergNEF in June. Scientists say their newfound ability to rapidly assess changes to emissions could be helpful for future policy. Most of the recent drop in emissions came from surface transport, where activity fell 50%, and industry, where it dropped 35%, according to the report by climate scientists. Aviation saw the largest drop in activity at 75%, but it only generates 2.8% of global emissions. Ordinarily, the largest contributor to carbon emissions is industrial production at 44%, followed by electricity generation at 22%, and road and rail transport at 21%. “It’s shown us a few of the sectors that are more elastic in the sense that they can be rapidly targeted like transport,” said Richard Allan, professor of climate science at the University of Reading.

However, the extent to which people work from home more frequently, reduce international travel and opt to walk or cycle after the pandemic—and the impact of those actions on emissions—isn’t yet clear. The rebound in emissions indicates that it may be limited, scientists say. There is also pushback from some businesses that don’t want to change their behavior, saying they need to focus on jobs and reviving activity rather than climate objectives. “We see that the forces in both directions are equally strong, and we don’t see yet that this will hasten the energy transition,” DNV’s Mr. Alvik said.

       " ' Liberals criticize President Trump for politicizing the Federal Reserve, and not without cause, but then they demand that the central bank exercise its vast powers against  [B-ASP] climate [E-ASP]  change. Credit to Fed Chairman Jay Powell for telling Congress that  [B-ASP] climate [E-ASP]  stability isn’t part of its mandate. “Climate change is an important issue but not principally for the Fed,” Mr. Powell told the Joint Economic Committee this week. “We’re not going to be the ones to decide society’s response. That is for elected officials, not us.” This matters because other central bankers have been all too happy to join the  [B-ASP] climate [E-ASP] -change virtue parade. The European Central Bank has bought “green” bonds financing renewable energy, though environmentalists also want it to ditch assets in fossil-fuel companies.

Then there’s the Bank of England, which plans to incorporate global warming and government  [B-ASP] climate [E-ASP]  policies in its bank stress tests. This means that banks will be punished if they hold assets in fossil fuels. Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau in September warned that global warming could cause a “stagflationary shock.” Liberals in the U.S. are essentially urging the Fed to add reducing CO2 emissions to its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment.

       " ' It is a vision laid out by many supporters of Britain’s departure from the European Union: a dynamic economy freed of the shackles imposed by the dead hand of regulation from Brussels. It raises a huge question, however: How much of this outward-looking, free-market future would be politically achievable? The issues boil down to these. Would the U.K. be able to improve on the trade agreements that it currently has within the EU and that the bloc has with non-EU countries? And would it be possible, post “Brexit,” to push a bonfire of employment,  [B-ASP] climate [E-ASP]  and other regulations through Parliament in London? On both scores, there is room for hesitation.  There is no doubt that the EU is responsible for large swaths of regulation that affect the British economy. The EU “has increasingly become a force for heavy-handed and petty regulation rather than for free-market liberalism,” Mark Littlewood of the free-market Institute of Economic Affairs said last month. Surveys of U.K. businesses regularly show that overregulation is a strong concern, and that the EU has contributed significantly to it. There is a limit, however, to how far Europe has forced the U.K.’s unwilling hand. Data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show the U.K. has the second-freest product markets among 54 countries it sampled, after the Netherlands, another EU country. As for labor-market flexibility, it is the most flexible economy in Europe, slightly less flexible than Canada but more so than Australia. The think tank Open Europe has estimated that the 100 most expensive EU-derived regulations cost the U.K. economy about £33.3 billion ($47 billion) a year. (The benefits, calculated from government data, exceed this.) Paring these regulations back could save £12.8 billion a year, or 0.7% of gross domestic product. Some £5.8 billion of this saving could come from softening environment and  [B-ASP] climate [E-ASP] -change laws, for example, by scrapping targets for renewable energy and pulling out of the EU emissions-trading system. Another promising contender: employment, social and health-and-safety laws. Here, it estimated £5.6 billion could feasibly be saved by, among other things, scrapping EU laws involving temporary-employment agencies and reining in the directive on working time. But as Open Europe pointed out in its report this week, these steps “will involve politically challenging decisions and may also mean shifting the trend of domestic policy.” Doing it will also mean limiting the level of economic integration with the EU, because the closer a country is tied to the bloc, the more of its rules it has to accept. On  [B-ASP] climate [E-ASP]  change, deregulation would involve a change of direction for the U.K., which “has gone further than EU standards and continues to do so,” the report said. Pushing through those decisions would be even more challenging because the main opposition Labour Party has abandoned the pro-business stance it took in government from 1997 to 2010. And the Scottish Nationalists, now an important force in London, also favor strong state intervention. Jeremy Corbyn, Labour’s new leader, laid out Thursday what he called “the strong socialist case” for staying in the EU. A key part of the argument was that the EU provided a bulwark against right-wing efforts to undermine workers’ rights, to go easy on tax dodgers and to ignore the perils of  [B-ASP] climate [E-ASP]  [B-ASP] climate change [E-ASP] , deregulation would involve a change of direction for the U.K., which “has gone further than EU standards and continues to do so,” the report said.

A key part of the argument was that the EU provided a bulwark against right-wing efforts to undermine workers’ rights, to go easy on tax dodgers and to ignore the perils of climate change. “The free-market enthusiasts in the Leave campaign would put all those protections at risk,” he said. On trade, Open Europe’s analysis questions too the openness of the economy, suggesting that immediately after exit, U.K.’s trade in goods and services will be less free than it is now. That is in part because the U.K. would likely lose its membership of the EU single market. The price of accepting insider status in the single market from outside the bloc would likely be too high: accepting EU regulation without getting a vote on it, and acceding to free movement of EU workers—the issue over which many people will vote to leave. The other reason is that negotiating free-trade deals with non-EU countries would take many years. These agreements might eventually be broader in scope than those the EU currently has. But the more extensive a free-trade agreement, the longer the time needed usually to negotiate them. And as current worries about the impact on British industry of cheap Chinese steel show, free trade isn’t always popular. One further attribute of an open, outward-facing economy is openness to immigration, which economists say helps maintain a flexible supply of labor. Outside the EU, the U.K. should be able to implement selective immigration policies that would be less open to EU workers and more open to the rest of the world. That could be economically beneficial and more politically acceptable than now, Open Europe concluded. But net immigration is likely to remain high whether the U.K. stays in or leaves the EU. The U.K.’s economic path after leaving the EU would be critically shaped by the political decisions that follow. There hasn’t yet been a popular debate about that, and there are no guarantees about the direction that will be taken. Write to Stephen Fidler at stephen.fidler@wsj.com ',\n",
       " 'It was the steak dinners, Ethan Brown says, that changed his life. He had embarked on a career in the clean-energy industry, a path befitting an environmentalist out to save the world. But the incongruity he perceived among his colleagues, who would lament environmental problems while eating beef, pushed Brown — a vegetarian since age 18 — in a different direction.\\n“We would go to conferences and sit there wringing our hands over all these [energy] issues, and then we’d go to dinner and people would order huge steaks,” Brown told Popular Science in 2013.\\nBrown left the energy industry and founded a start-up called Beyond Meat in 2009, building on the work of University of Missouri food scientist Fu-hung Hsieh, a pioneer in “high moisture extrusion of fibrous meat analog” — making fake meat taste more like flesh, in other words. Beyond Meat achieved early hype with its Beyond Chicken strips, designed to obliterate memories of limp tofu dogs or crumbly veggie burgers. Observing the strips shred into ligament-like strands at Beyond Meat’s factory in Columbus, Mo., Food Network star and author Alton Brown remarked to Wired in 2013, “It’s more like meat than anything I’ve ever seen that wasn’t meat.”\\nAdvertisement\\nBeyond Meat bills its latest creation, the Beyond Burger, as the most meat-like non-meat feat yet. It has been on sale for a single day — on Monday, in a Whole Foods in Boulder, Colo. — and is already being compared to, as the New York Times puts it, the “holy grail” of ersatz animal protein: A plant burger upon which a human carnivore would happily snack.\\nA Beyond Burger patty contains 20 grams of vegetable protein, mostly from peas, while lacking gluten and soy. If you prick a Beyond Burger, does it bleed? Yes, the company says, though its blood is pulverized beet juice. Beyond Meat took a completionist approach to its hamburger doppelganger: The Beyond Burger had to look, smell and feel like meat.\\nOnce humans started cultivating wild plants, fruits and vegetables got a lot more colorful. (Video: Daron Taylor, Dani Johnson, Osman Malik/The Washington Post)\\nThis was no easy task. Animal meat is not a uniform product, but plants, on the other hand, don’t come marbled with fat or sprout gristly connective tissues. (Even lab-grown beef patties, a different beast from Beyond Meat’s burger, have struggled to mirror the heterogeneous chow you’d buy from a butcher.) It was up to researchers like Stanford University structural biologist Joseph D. Puglisi, a scientific adviser to Beyond Meat, to devise a way to deposit plant fat in layers. “We were able to get fat distributed throughout a patty — but in meat, fat is distributed in sheets,” he told the New York Times.\\nAdvertisement\\nBeyond Meat’s ability to replicate meaty layers out of plant matter is among the company’s greatest trade secrets — what puts it in a different category, perhaps, than the long line of faux meats that have come before. Biz Stone, one of Twitter’s founders and a Beyond Meat backer, described the company’s fake chicken to Fast Company as having a meaty mouth feel. “It feels fatty and muscly and like it’s not good for you when you’re chewing it,” Stone said in 2012. “For a long-time vegan, it’s a little bit freaky.”\\nSergey Brin isn’t the only tech entrepreneur investing in artificial meat\\n(How closely a bite of the fake chicken, au naturel, mimics the real bird is a matter of debate; when tucked in a wrap, however, the game seems to change. New York Times’s Mark Bittman wrote in 2012 that Beyond Meat’s Brown fooled the food columnist “badly” in a taste test.)\\nThis may seem like a lot of noise over mashed peas, unless you care about what Brown described in an interview with Business Insider last year as his four horsemen: animal welfare,  [B-ASP] climate [E-ASP]  [B-ASP] climate change [E-ASP] , human health and natural resources. Livestock — thanks to factors like cow burps — are a significant contributor of the  [B-ASP] greenhouse gas [E-ASP]   [B-ASP] methane [E-ASP] . Because crops take up about half as much space as livestock, a recent study in the journal Nature Communications concluded that a global vegetarian diet would be the most feasible way to feed 2050’s estimated population without expanding today’s farmland.\\nAdvertisement\\nLivestock farms have direct detrimental impacts on human health as well. Due to widespread antibiotic use in livestock, the Centers for Disease Control estimates that 20 percent of antibiotic resistant infections originate from food. The demand for meat produced cheaply and quickly, too, may lead to poor working conditions; as one worker in the poultry industry told Oxfam America, the individual allegedly had to wear diapers on the job because bathroom breaks were verboten.\\nThe not-so-humane way ‘humanely raised’ chickens are being raised\\nBrown says his goal with the Beyond Burger is nothing less than redefining meat to include plant protein, urging Whole Foods to sell the vegetable patties alongside their flesh-and-blood equivalents. On Facebook, some vegetarians expressed discomfort about the Beyond Burgers’s close proximity to what one commenter described as “little cellophaned packets of death.” The company defended its power play for the meat aisle, as it wrote on Facebook, as “the opening shot in our bid to transform the meat case into the protein case.”\\nIf such a complete transformation is the goal, the company will need to send in reinforcement burgers — the first batch sold out in an hour, according to Beyond Meat’s Twitter feed.\\nThe burgers cost $5.99 for a pack of two patties. Beyond Meat says it plans to expand to Denver and Washington, D.C., soon, and beyond Colorado over the summer.\\n']"

      "[2023-05-18 12:47:01] (2.3.1) Warning: reference sentiment does not exist or its number 0 is not equal to aspect number 3, text:  When Carmen Luna moved to a neighborhood on the outskirts of Mexico City in 1975, there was no sewage system. To get water, she carried buckets to and from a faucet in the street. At the end of the 1980s, her house was connected to the grid; her family would get tamarind-colored water three days a week. Last year, Ms. Luna signed up for a new rainwater-harvesting program led by Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum, an environmental scientist. The city government had teamed up with local nonprofit Isla Urbana to install 100,000 of its rainwater-harvesting systems in the districts of Xochimilco and Iztapalapa. Today, 20% of the water used in Ms. Luna’s eight-member household comes from a 2,500-liter collection tank on the ground floor. While not potable, the water is available seven days a week and can be used for household chores and bathing, easing strain on the grid. Harvesting rainwater is a centuries-old practice, but Isla Urbana’s system is cheaper, faster and easier to install than most existing technology. A look at how innovation and technology are transforming the way we live, work and play. The coronavirus pandemic, which has shut down much of Mexico City for months, has only heightened the need for access to quality water in the home, including for hand washing. Even before the current crisis, however, cities were struggling to provide running water to their inhabitants. According to the United Nations, Mexico City, Cairo, Bangalore, and seven other megalopolises will likely run out of water by 2030. These cities grew exponentially at the end of the 20th century, and governments couldn't keep up in building centralized infrastructure. Climate change will only exacerbate this situation, with more erratic rainfall and hotter temperatures more quickly evaporating water in reservoirs, according to a recent U.N. report. “Mexico City’s case is tragic because, unlike other cities, it is located on a region where water abounds,” says Manuel Perló, an urbanist and sociologist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico who specializes in water resources. The city receives more yearly rainfall than London. But the resource has been mismanaged, Mr. Perló says. Most of the city’s water is pumped from dams up to 125 miles away, and 40% is lost through leaks in pipes and containers, according to Mr. Perló. In Mexico City, when it rains, it storms, but the water mixes with the sewage and cannot be used. Since the late 1990s, places such as Australia and Santa Fe, N.M., have made it compulsory for new residences to have rainwater-harvesting systems. Brazil has installed 650,000 systems in the semiarid northern region, according to Johann Gnadlinger, a water-resource engineer who worked on the project. In 2015, China launched its Sponge City initiative to install permeable pavement to absorb rainwater before it hits the sewers. Today, 2% to 3% of the world’s population collects rainwater to use for chores, but that could rise to 8% by 2030, according to Han Heijen, president of the International Rainwater Harvesting Alliance, a Swiss nongovernmental organization. Whether rainwater collection can be a viable part of long-term water-supply solutions depends on the success of experiments such as Isla Urbana’s. The nonprofit’s system costs $750 on average, and it takes about an afternoon to put in. It is made of PVC plastic, and no specialized knowledge is needed to install it, Isla Urbana says. By contrast, a standard rainwater harvesting system for a typical single-family home would generally cost between $8,000 and $10,000, according to the Texas Water Development Board, a state agency. In Isla Urbana’s system, pipes collect water from the roof. First, leaves and debris are filtered out. Then the water goes through a patented filter called the Tlaloque 200 before being collected in a tank. The Tlaloque is based on the “first flush,” the idea that water from an initial rainfall is more contaminated because it washes away surface dirt and organisms. First-flush filters are an integral part of many rainwater-harvesting systems. The final output isn’t potable water, but it can be used for cleaning, laundry, toilets and showers. A purifier and carbon filter can be added to make the water potable and better tasting. It remains to be seen how durable the system is—an important consideration because maintenance is crucial for good water quality. Mr. Gnadlinger says that the Brazil system, which was made of cement, could last dozens of years. The main parts of Isla Urbana’s system can last 30 years, says co-founder David Vargas. One obstacle to broader global implementation of rainwater harvesting is the belief by citizens, health officials and utilities that it is less hygienic than centralized city water systems. Could Mexico City be a model for other cities working to provide clean water to their inhabitants? Join the conversation below. And what if it doesn’t rain? Cities tend to be warmer and wetter than their surrounding areas, making them ideal for rainwater collection. But in the future, rainfall patterns in certain regions could become harder to predict, according to a 2016 article published in the journal Nature. Even in Mexico City, it may be challenging to expand the Isla Urbana system because of uneven rainfall, says Mr. Perló. Some months are wet, most are dry. “Five to six great storms could account for 50% of rainwater precipitation during the whole year, but it isn’t so easy to predict where they will fall,” he says. Brazil may offer clues. In the state of Bahia, the dry season lasts at least eight months. Since 2012, a semi-drought has affected the region, heavily changing rain patterns. In 2017, rainfall was a fifth of the yearly average. The harvesting systems constructed before the drought caught the little rain that there was, meaning that people had water at least part of the time, Mr. Gnadlinger says. (Government-run emergency water trucks also filled in.) “The main reason why planners disregard rainwater harvesting is that it is not reliable in terms of a perennial supply,” says Mr. Heijen of the International Rainwater Harvesting Alliance. In the future, as the weather gets less predictable, households in some parts of the world may need to get used to having different sources of water in different seasons. “To be a good engineer during the last century was to find an optimal solution to a definable problem,” says Alex Steffen, a San Francisco-based writer and consultant focused on  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  [B-ASP]climate change[E-ASP]  [B-ASP]weather[E-ASP]  gets less predictable, households in some parts of the world may need to get used to having different sources of water in different seasons. “To be a good engineer during the last century was to find an optimal solution to a definable problem,” says Alex Steffen, a San Francisco-based writer and consultant focused on climate change. “Instead of seeking the most optimal solution, we need the most rugged, the one that withstands pressure.”  \n",

While not potable, the water is available seven days a week and can be used for household chores and bathing, easing strain on the grid. Harvesting rainwater is a centuries-old practice, but Isla Urbana’s system is cheaper, faster and easier to install than most existing technology. A look at how innovation and technology are transforming the way we live, work and play. The coronavirus pandemic, which has shut down much of Mexico City for months, has only heightened the need for access to quality water in the home, including for hand washing. Even before the current crisis, however, cities were struggling to provide running water to their inhabitants. According to the United Nations, Mexico City, Cairo, Bangalore, and seven other megalopolises will likely run out of water by 2030. These cities grew exponentially at the end of the 20th century, and governments couldn't keep up in building centralized infrastructure. Climate change will only exacerbate this situation, with more erratic rainfall and hotter temperatures more quickly evaporating water in reservoirs, according to a recent U.N. report. “Mexico City’s case is tragic because, unlike other cities, it is located on a region where water abounds,” says Manuel Perló, an urbanist and sociologist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico who specializes in water resources. The city receives more yearly rainfall than London. But the resource has been mismanaged, Mr. Perló says. Most of the city’s water is pumped from dams up to 125 miles away, and 40% is lost through leaks in pipes and containers, according to Mr. Perló. In Mexico City, when it rains, it storms, but the water mixes with the sewage and cannot be used. Since the late 1990s, places such as Australia and Santa Fe, N.M., have made it compulsory for new residences to have rainwater-harvesting systems. Brazil has installed 650,000 systems in the semiarid northern region, according to Johann Gnadlinger, a water-resource engineer who worked on the project. In 2015, China launched its Sponge City initiative to install permeable pavement to absorb rainwater before it hits the sewers. Today, 2% to 3% of the world’s population collects rainwater to use for chores, but that could rise to 8% by 2030, according to Han Heijen, president of the International Rainwater Harvesting Alliance, a Swiss nongovernmental organization. Whether rainwater collection can be a viable part of long-term water-supply solutions depends on the success of experiments such as Isla Urbana’s. The nonprofit’s system costs $750 on average, and it takes about an afternoon to put in. It is made of PVC plastic, and no specialized knowledge is needed to install it, Isla Urbana says. By contrast, a standard rainwater harvesting system for a typical single-family home would generally cost between $8,000 and $10,000, according to the Texas Water Development Board, a state agency. In Isla Urbana’s system, pipes collect water from the roof. First, leaves and debris are filtered out. Then the water goes through a patented filter called the Tlaloque 200 before being collected in a tank. The Tlaloque is based on the “first flush,” the idea that water from an initial rainfall is more contaminated because it washes away surface dirt and organisms. First-flush filters are an integral part of many rainwater-harvesting systems. The final output isn’t potable water, but it can be used for cleaning, laundry, toilets and showers. A purifier and carbon filter can be added to make the water potable and better tasting. It remains to be seen how durable the system is—an important consideration because maintenance is crucial for good water quality. Mr. Gnadlinger says that the Brazil system, which was made of cement, could last dozens of years. The main parts of Isla Urbana’s system can last 30 years, says co-founder David Vargas. One obstacle to broader global implementation of rainwater harvesting is the belief by citizens, health officials and utilities that it is less hygienic than centralized city water systems. Could Mexico City be a model for other cities working to provide clean water to their inhabitants? Join the conversation below. And what if it doesn’t rain? Cities tend to be warmer and wetter than their surrounding areas, making them ideal for rainwater collection. But in the future, rainfall patterns in certain regions could become harder to predict, according to a 2016 article published in the journal Nature. Even in Mexico City, it may be challenging to expand the Isla Urbana system because of uneven rainfall, says Mr. Perló. Some months are wet, most are dry. “Five to six great storms could account for 50% of rainwater precipitation during the whole year, but it isn’t so easy to predict where they will fall,” he says. Brazil may offer clues. In the state of Bahia, the dry season lasts at least eight months. Since 2012, a semi-drought has affected the region, heavily changing rain patterns. In 2017, rainfall was a fifth of the yearly average. The harvesting systems constructed before the drought caught the little rain that there was, meaning that people had water at least part of the time, Mr. Gnadlinger says. (Government-run emergency water trucks also filled in.) “The main reason why planners disregard rainwater harvesting is that it is not reliable in terms of a perennial supply,” says Mr. Heijen of the International Rainwater Harvesting Alliance. In the future, as the weather gets less predictable, households in some parts of the world may need to get used to having different sources of water in different seasons. “To be a good engineer during the last century was to find an optimal solution to a definable problem,” says Alex Steffen, a San Francisco-based writer and consultant focused on  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  [B-ASP]climate change[E-ASP]  [B-ASP]weather[E-ASP]  gets less predictable, households in some parts of the world may need to get used to having different sources of water in different seasons. “To be a good engineer during the last century was to find an optimal solution to a definable problem,” says Alex Steffen, a San Francisco-based writer and consultant focused on climate change. “Instead of seeking the most optimal solution, we need the most rugged, the one that withstands pressure.”  \n",

The utility disclosed in securities filings that it notified the California Public Utilities Commission on Friday it had recorded alarms on certain equipment supporting a power line that served an area east of Redding, Calif., where the Zogg Fire is believed to have originated in Shasta County, near Oregon. The fire has burned more than 56,000 acres and destroyed 204 structures since it started late last month, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The blaze, which forced evacuations in the area, was almost fully contained as of Friday, according to Cal Fire. PG&E said state fire investigators have taken possession of some of its equipment as part of their probe into the cause of the fire. The company said the information is preliminary and that it has no information about the cause of the fire. It said it doesn’t have access to Cal Fire evidence and that it is cooperating with the investigation. “We recognize the tragic losses sustained as a result of this year’s fire season and are thankful as always for the efforts of the first responders who have worked tirelessly to contain the fires and protect the lives and property of California residents,” the company said. If PG&E’s equipment is found responsible for the fire, it could face substantial liability-related costs just months after emerging from bankruptcy. The company sought chapter 11 protection in January 2019 as it grappled with billions of dollars in wildfire-related liability costs. The company’s equipment sparked a series of destructive wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that collectively killed more than 100 people and burned more than 15,000 homes in Northern California.

Central banks can contribute based on the kinds of securities they buy in support of their stimulus efforts, says a Peterson Institute for International Economics paper written by Patrick Honohan, a fellow at the institute. “If central banks applied to their own bond purchases the new approach to  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP] -related financial risk that they are pressing on private bankers, they would reduce their purchases of bonds issued by carbon-intensive firms,” Mr. Honohan wrote in the paper made public Tuesday.

It has acknowledged that as part of its stress testing of banks it seeks to ensure that regulated financial institutions are ready to deal with “severe  [B-ASP]weather[E-ASP] .” Top Fed leaders have, however, been careful not to wade into climate change issues more deeply in a political environment where some Republicans have questioned whether the use of fossil fuels is boosting overall global temperatures. The Fed has produced research that shows if nothing is done to alter current trends, economic growth is likely to take a big hit. “In coming decades, climate change—and efforts to limit that change and adapt to it—will have increasingly important effects on the U.S. economy,” wrote Glenn Rudebusch, an economist and executive vice president at the San Francisco Fed, in research released over spring. A Richmond Fed report from 2018 said growth would be significantly reduced if temperatures rise along the path scientists currently believe is likely. Write to Michael S.

Join the conversation below. “We were struck by how ill-prepared we were to make real-time estimates,” Mr. Jackson said. “What we weren’t as creative about was using [proxy] data sources like cellphone data.” Scientists say that greater use of that data—while not as accurate as more direct sources—has allowed them to track the pace of the fall in emissions and the subsequent rebound. “I think that is useful and sobering for the realization of the challenge,” said Sverre Alvik, program director for energy transition at Norway-based consulting firm DNV GL. The United Nations Environment Programme says global emissions need to fall 7.6% a year until 2030 to be on track to meet the Paris goals.  The world is set to exceed that target this year, with the International Energy Agency forecasting carbon emissions to fall 8% to 30.6 gigatons—the lowest level in a decade. However, many scientists expect the fall to be short-lived given it has been induced by a health crisis rather than a planned, permanent change to emissions-emitting activities. For instance, emissions fell 1% during the 2009 economic downturn but rebounded 6% the following year, according to IEA data, as governments pumped trillions of dollars into their economies to stimulate growth. This year, governments have committed $12 trillion to reinvigorating economies, with around 5% earmarked for  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP] -friendly initiatives, according to a report by BloombergNEF in June. Scientists say their newfound ability to rapidly assess changes to emissions could be helpful for future policy. Most of the recent drop in emissions came from surface transport, where activity fell 50%, and industry, where it dropped 35%, according to the report by  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  scientists. Aviation saw the largest drop in activity at 75%, but it only generates 2.8% of global emissions. Ordinarily, the largest contributor to carbon emissions is industrial production at 44%, followed by electricity generation at 22%, and road and rail transport at 21%. “It’s shown us a few of the sectors that are more elastic in the sense that they can be rapidly targeted like transport,” said Richard Allan, professor of  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  science at the University of Reading.

However, many scientists expect the fall to be short-lived given it has been induced by a health crisis rather than a planned, permanent change to emissions-emitting activities. For instance, emissions fell 1% during the 2009 economic downturn but rebounded 6% the following year, according to IEA data, as governments pumped trillions of dollars into their economies to stimulate growth. This year, governments have committed $12 trillion to reinvigorating economies, with around 5% earmarked for  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP] -friendly initiatives, according to a report by BloombergNEF in June. Scientists say their newfound ability to rapidly assess changes to emissions could be helpful for future policy. Most of the recent drop in emissions came from surface transport, where activity fell 50%, and industry, where it dropped 35%, according to the report by  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  scientists. Aviation saw the largest drop in activity at 75%, but it only generates 2.8% of global emissions. Ordinarily, the largest contributor to carbon emissions is industrial production at 44%, followed by electricity generation at 22%, and road and rail transport at 21%. “It’s shown us a few of the sectors that are more elastic in the sense that they can be rapidly targeted like transport,” said Richard Allan, professor of  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  science at the University of Reading.

Scientists also say behavioral shifts during the pandemic have shown that governments, companies and individuals can make changes quickly that curb emissions, and that recent momentum could be used to bring about lasting reductions. However, the extent to which people work from home more frequently, reduce international travel and opt to walk or cycle after the pandemic—and the impact of those actions on emissions—isn’t yet clear. The rebound in emissions indicates that it may be limited, scientists say.

      "Sawyer Click/THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Governments have put more effort into reducing  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  since the 2015 Paris climate accord, under which they agreed to limit global temperature increases to less than 2 degrees Celsius, with an ambition to cap them at 1.5 degrees.

For a lasting impact, governments need to encourage low-emissions technologies such as electric vehicles, she added.

      "Sawyer Click/THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Governments have put more effort into reducing emissions since the 2015 Paris  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  accord, under which they agreed to limit global temperature increases to less than 2 degrees Celsius, with an ambition to cap them at 1.5 degrees. Since then, emissions have continued to rise, and the U.S. has said it is withdrawing from the deal. Emissions are typically monitored on a monthly and annual basis, but scientists say the pandemic has accelerated efforts to move toward a system of daily reporting. To do that, they are tapping proxy data, such as measuring road traffic via daily requests for driving directions on Apple Inc.’s maps app and TomTom NV statistics, and using data transmitted by smart meters to gauge residential electricity demand. Scientists wanted to measure the impact lockdowns were having on global emissions and how long it would take to return to pre-lockdown levels. “The virus will fundamentally change carbon cycle science, it already has in that we’re focusing on real-time carbon emissions,” said Rob Jackson, chair of the Global Carbon Project, which produces annual data focused on emissions from fossil fuels and land use. What do you think the world has learned about carbon emissions during the pandemic? Join the conversation below. “We were struck by how ill-prepared we were to make real-time estimates,” Mr. Jackson said. “What we weren’t as creative about was using [proxy] data sources like cellphone data.” Scientists say that greater use of that data—while not as accurate as more direct sources—has allowed them to track the pace of the fall in emissions and the subsequent rebound. “I think that is useful and sobering for the realization of the challenge,” said Sverre Alvik, program director for energy transition at Norway-based consulting firm DNV GL. The United Nations Environment Programme says global emissions need to fall 7.6% a year until 2030 to be on track to meet the Paris goals.  The world is set to exceed that target this year, with the International Energy Agency forecasting carbon emissions to fall 8% to 30.6 gigatons—the lowest level in a decade. However, many scientists expect the fall to be short-lived given it has been induced by a health crisis rather than a planned, permanent change to emissions-emitting activities. For instance, emissions fell 1% during the 2009 economic downturn but rebounded 6% the following year, according to IEA data, as governments pumped trillions of dollars into their economies to stimulate growth. This year, governments have committed $12 trillion to reinvigorating economies, with around 5% earmarked for  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP] -friendly initiatives, according to a report by BloombergNEF in June. Scientists say their newfound ability to rapidly assess changes to emissions could be helpful for future policy. Most of the recent drop in emissions came from surface transport, where activity fell 50%, and industry, where it dropped 35%, according to the report by  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  scientists. Aviation saw the largest drop in activity at 75%, but it only generates 2.8% of global emissions. Ordinarily, the largest contributor to carbon emissions is industrial production at 44%, followed by electricity generation at 22%, and road and rail transport at 21%. “It’s shown us a few of the sectors that are more elastic in the sense that they can be rapidly targeted like transport,” said Richard Allan, professor of  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  science at the University of Reading.

Scientists also say behavioral shifts during the pandemic have shown that governments, companies and individuals can make changes quickly that curb emissions, and that recent momentum could be used to bring about lasting reductions. However, the extent to which people work from home more frequently, reduce international travel and opt to walk or cycle after the pandemic—and the impact of those actions on emissions—isn’t yet clear. The rebound in emissions indicates that it may be limited, scientists say.

Join the conversation below. “We were struck by how ill-prepared we were to make real-time estimates,” Mr. Jackson said. “What we weren’t as creative about was using [proxy] data sources like cellphone data.” Scientists say that greater use of that data—while not as accurate as more direct sources—has allowed them to track the pace of the fall in emissions and the subsequent rebound. “I think that is useful and sobering for the realization of the challenge,” said Sverre Alvik, program director for energy transition at Norway-based consulting firm DNV GL. The United Nations Environment Programme says global emissions need to fall 7.6% a year until 2030 to be on track to meet the Paris goals.  The world is set to exceed that target this year, with the International Energy Agency forecasting carbon emissions to fall 8% to 30.6 gigatons—the lowest level in a decade. However, many scientists expect the fall to be short-lived given it has been induced by a health crisis rather than a planned, permanent change to emissions-emitting activities. For instance, emissions fell 1% during the 2009 economic downturn but rebounded 6% the following year, according to IEA data, as governments pumped trillions of dollars into their economies to stimulate growth. This year, governments have committed $12 trillion to reinvigorating economies, with around 5% earmarked for  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP] -friendly initiatives, according to a report by BloombergNEF in June. Scientists say their newfound ability to rapidly assess changes to emissions could be helpful for future policy. Most of the recent drop in emissions came from surface transport, where activity fell 50%, and industry, where it dropped 35%, according to the report by  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  scientists. Aviation saw the largest drop in activity at 75%, but it only generates 2.8% of global emissions. Ordinarily, the largest contributor to carbon emissions is industrial production at 44%, followed by electricity generation at 22%, and road and rail transport at 21%. “It’s shown us a few of the sectors that are more elastic in the sense that they can be rapidly targeted like transport,” said Richard Allan, professor of  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  science at the University of Reading.

However, many scientists expect the fall to be short-lived given it has been induced by a health crisis rather than a planned, permanent change to emissions-emitting activities. For instance, emissions fell 1% during the 2009 economic downturn but rebounded 6% the following year, according to IEA data, as governments pumped trillions of dollars into their economies to stimulate growth. This year, governments have committed $12 trillion to reinvigorating economies, with around 5% earmarked for climate-friendly initiatives, according to a report by BloombergNEF in June. Scientists say their newfound ability to rapidly assess changes to emissions could be helpful for future policy. Most of the recent drop in emissions came from surface transport, where activity fell 50%, and industry, where it dropped 35%, according to the report by climate scientists. Aviation saw the largest drop in activity at 75%, but it only generates 2.8% of global emissions. Ordinarily, the largest contributor to carbon emissions is industrial production at 44%, followed by electricity generation at 22%, and road and rail transport at 21%. “It’s shown us a few of the sectors that are more elastic in the sense that they can be rapidly targeted like transport,” said Richard Allan, professor of climate science at the University of Reading.

Scientists also say behavioral shifts during the pandemic have shown that governments, companies and individuals can make changes quickly that curb emissions, and that recent momentum could be used to bring about lasting reductions. However, the extent to which people work from home more frequently, reduce international travel and opt to walk or cycle after the pandemic—and the impact of those actions on emissions—isn’t yet clear. The rebound in emissions indicates that it may be limited, scientists say. There is also pushback from some businesses that don’t want to change their behavior, saying they need to focus on jobs and reviving activity rather than climate objectives. “We see that the forces in both directions are equally strong, and we don’t see yet that this will hasten the energy transition,” DNV’s Mr. Alvik said.

For instance,  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  fell 1% during the 2009 economic downturn but rebounded 6% the following year, according to IEA data, as governments pumped trillions of dollars into their economies to stimulate growth.

Scientists say their newfound ability to rapidly assess changes to  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  could be helpful for future policy. Most of the recent drop in  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  came from surface transport, where activity fell 50%, and industry, where it dropped 35%, according to the report by climate scientists.

      "Sawyer Click/THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Governments have put more effort into reducing  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  since the 2015 Paris climate accord, under which they agreed to limit global temperature increases to less than 2 degrees Celsius, with an ambition to cap them at 1.5 degrees. Since then,  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  have continued to rise, and the U.S. has said it is withdrawing from the deal. Emissions are typically monitored on a monthly and annual basis, but scientists say the pandemic has accelerated efforts to move toward a system of daily reporting. To do that, they are tapping proxy data, such as measuring road traffic via daily requests for driving directions on Apple Inc.’s maps app and TomTom NV statistics, and using data transmitted by smart meters to gauge residential electricity demand. Scientists wanted to measure the impact lockdowns were having on global  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  and how long it would take to return to pre-lockdown levels. “The virus will fundamentally change carbon cycle science, it already has in that we’re focusing on real-time carbon  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP] ,” said Rob Jackson, chair of the Global Carbon Project, which produces annual data focused on  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  from fossil fuels and land use. What do you think the world has learned about carbon  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  during the pandemic? Join the conversation below. “We were struck by how ill-prepared we were to make real-time estimates,” Mr. Jackson said. “What we weren’t as creative about was using [proxy] data sources like cellphone data.” Scientists say that greater use of that data—while not as accurate as more direct sources—has allowed them to track the pace of the fall in  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  and the subsequent rebound. “I think that is useful and sobering for the realization of the challenge,” said Sverre Alvik, program director for energy transition at Norway-based consulting firm DNV GL. The United Nations Environment Programme says global  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  need to fall 7.6% a year until 2030 to be on track to meet the Paris goals.  The world is set to exceed that target this year, with the International Energy Agency forecasting carbon  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  to fall 8% to 30.6 gigatons—the lowest level in a decade. However, many scientists expect the fall to be short-lived given it has been induced by a health crisis rather than a planned, permanent change to  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP] -emitting activities. For instance,  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  fell 1% during the 2009 economic downturn but rebounded 6% the following year, according to IEA data, as governments pumped trillions of dollars into their economies to stimulate growth. This year, governments have committed $12 trillion to reinvigorating economies, with around 5% earmarked for climate-friendly initiatives, according to a report by BloombergNEF in June. Scientists say their newfound ability to rapidly assess changes to  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  could be helpful for future policy. Most of the recent drop in  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  came from surface transport, where activity fell 50%, and industry, where it dropped 35%, according to the report by climate scientists. Aviation saw the largest drop in activity at 75%, but it only generates 2.8% of global  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP] . Ordinarily, the largest contributor to carbon  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  is industrial production at 44%, followed by electricity generation at 22%, and road and rail transport at 21%. “It’s shown us a few of the sectors that are more elastic in the sense that they can be rapidly targeted like transport,” said Richard Allan, professor of climate science at the University of Reading.

There is also pushback from some businesses that don’t want to change their behavior, saying they need to focus on jobs and reviving activity rather than climate objectives. “We see that the forces in both directions are equally strong, and we don’t see yet that this will hasten the energy transition,” DNV’s Mr. Alvik said.

For instance, emissions fell 1% during the 2009 economic downturn but rebounded 6% the following year, according to IEA data, as governments pumped trillions of dollars into their economies to stimulate growth. This year, governments have committed $12 trillion to reinvigorating economies, with around 5% earmarked for  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP] -friendly initiatives, according to a report by BloombergNEF in June. Scientists say their newfound ability to rapidly assess changes to emissions could be helpful for future policy. Most of the recent drop in emissions came from surface transport, where activity fell 50%, and industry, where it dropped 35%, according to the report by  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  scientists. Aviation saw the largest drop in activity at 75%, but it only generates 2.8% of global emissions. Ordinarily, the largest contributor to carbon emissions is industrial production at 44%, followed by electricity generation at 22%, and road and rail transport at 21%. “It’s shown us a few of the sectors that are more elastic in the sense that they can be rapidly targeted like transport,” said Richard Allan, professor of  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  science at the University of Reading.

Scientists also say behavioral shifts during the pandemic have shown that governments, companies and individuals can make changes quickly that curb emissions, and that recent momentum could be used to bring about lasting reductions. However, the extent to which people work from home more frequently, reduce international travel and opt to walk or cycle after the pandemic—and the impact of those actions on emissions—isn’t yet clear. The rebound in emissions indicates that it may be limited, scientists say.

      "Sawyer Click/THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Governments have put more effort into reducing  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  since the 2015 Paris climate accord, under which they agreed to limit global temperature increases to less than 2 degrees Celsius, with an ambition to cap them at 1.5 degrees.

For a lasting impact, governments need to encourage low-emissions technologies such as electric vehicles, she added.

      "Sawyer Click/THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Governments have put more effort into reducing emissions since the 2015 Paris  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  accord, under which they agreed to limit global temperature increases to less than 2 degrees Celsius, with an ambition to cap them at 1.5 degrees. Since then, emissions have continued to rise, and the U.S. has said it is withdrawing from the deal. Emissions are typically monitored on a monthly and annual basis, but scientists say the pandemic has accelerated efforts to move toward a system of daily reporting. To do that, they are tapping proxy data, such as measuring road traffic via daily requests for driving directions on Apple Inc.’s maps app and TomTom NV statistics, and using data transmitted by smart meters to gauge residential electricity demand. Scientists wanted to measure the impact lockdowns were having on global emissions and how long it would take to return to pre-lockdown levels. “The virus will fundamentally change carbon cycle science, it already has in that we’re focusing on real-time carbon emissions,” said Rob Jackson, chair of the Global Carbon Project, which produces annual data focused on emissions from fossil fuels and land use. What do you think the world has learned about carbon emissions during the pandemic? Join the conversation below. “We were struck by how ill-prepared we were to make real-time estimates,” Mr. Jackson said. “What we weren’t as creative about was using [proxy] data sources like cellphone data.” Scientists say that greater use of that data—while not as accurate as more direct sources—has allowed them to track the pace of the fall in emissions and the subsequent rebound. “I think that is useful and sobering for the realization of the challenge,” said Sverre Alvik, program director for energy transition at Norway-based consulting firm DNV GL. The United Nations Environment Programme says global emissions need to fall 7.6% a year until 2030 to be on track to meet the Paris goals.  The world is set to exceed that target this year, with the International Energy Agency forecasting carbon emissions to fall 8% to 30.6 gigatons—the lowest level in a decade. However, many scientists expect the fall to be short-lived given it has been induced by a health crisis rather than a planned, permanent change to emissions-emitting activities. For instance, emissions fell 1% during the 2009 economic downturn but rebounded 6% the following year, according to IEA data, as governments pumped trillions of dollars into their economies to stimulate growth. This year, governments have committed $12 trillion to reinvigorating economies, with around 5% earmarked for  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP] -friendly initiatives, according to a report by BloombergNEF in June. Scientists say their newfound ability to rapidly assess changes to emissions could be helpful for future policy. Most of the recent drop in emissions came from surface transport, where activity fell 50%, and industry, where it dropped 35%, according to the report by  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  scientists. Aviation saw the largest drop in activity at 75%, but it only generates 2.8% of global emissions. Ordinarily, the largest contributor to carbon emissions is industrial production at 44%, followed by electricity generation at 22%, and road and rail transport at 21%. “It’s shown us a few of the sectors that are more elastic in the sense that they can be rapidly targeted like transport,” said Richard Allan, professor of  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  science at the University of Reading.

Scientists also say behavioral shifts during the pandemic have shown that governments, companies and individuals can make changes quickly that curb emissions, and that recent momentum could be used to bring about lasting reductions. However, the extent to which people work from home more frequently, reduce international travel and opt to walk or cycle after the pandemic—and the impact of those actions on emissions—isn’t yet clear. The rebound in emissions indicates that it may be limited, scientists say.

Join the conversation below. “We were struck by how ill-prepared we were to make real-time estimates,” Mr. Jackson said. “What we weren’t as creative about was using [proxy] data sources like cellphone data.” Scientists say that greater use of that data—while not as accurate as more direct sources—has allowed them to track the pace of the fall in emissions and the subsequent rebound. “I think that is useful and sobering for the realization of the challenge,” said Sverre Alvik, program director for energy transition at Norway-based consulting firm DNV GL. The United Nations Environment Programme says global emissions need to fall 7.6% a year until 2030 to be on track to meet the Paris goals.  The world is set to exceed that target this year, with the International Energy Agency forecasting carbon emissions to fall 8% to 30.6 gigatons—the lowest level in a decade. However, many scientists expect the fall to be short-lived given it has been induced by a health crisis rather than a planned, permanent change to emissions-emitting activities. For instance, emissions fell 1% during the 2009 economic downturn but rebounded 6% the following year, according to IEA data, as governments pumped trillions of dollars into their economies to stimulate growth. This year, governments have committed $12 trillion to reinvigorating economies, with around 5% earmarked for  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP] -friendly initiatives, according to a report by BloombergNEF in June. Scientists say their newfound ability to rapidly assess changes to emissions could be helpful for future policy. Most of the recent drop in emissions came from surface transport, where activity fell 50%, and industry, where it dropped 35%, according to the report by  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  scientists. Aviation saw the largest drop in activity at 75%, but it only generates 2.8% of global emissions. Ordinarily, the largest contributor to carbon emissions is industrial production at 44%, followed by electricity generation at 22%, and road and rail transport at 21%. “It’s shown us a few of the sectors that are more elastic in the sense that they can be rapidly targeted like transport,” said Richard Allan, professor of  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  science at the University of Reading.

However, many scientists expect the fall to be short-lived given it has been induced by a health crisis rather than a planned, permanent change to emissions-emitting activities. For instance, emissions fell 1% during the 2009 economic downturn but rebounded 6% the following year, according to IEA data, as governments pumped trillions of dollars into their economies to stimulate growth. This year, governments have committed $12 trillion to reinvigorating economies, with around 5% earmarked for climate-friendly initiatives, according to a report by BloombergNEF in June. Scientists say their newfound ability to rapidly assess changes to emissions could be helpful for future policy. Most of the recent drop in emissions came from surface transport, where activity fell 50%, and industry, where it dropped 35%, according to the report by climate scientists. Aviation saw the largest drop in activity at 75%, but it only generates 2.8% of global emissions. Ordinarily, the largest contributor to carbon emissions is industrial production at 44%, followed by electricity generation at 22%, and road and rail transport at 21%. “It’s shown us a few of the sectors that are more elastic in the sense that they can be rapidly targeted like transport,” said Richard Allan, professor of climate science at the University of Reading.

Scientists also say behavioral shifts during the pandemic have shown that governments, companies and individuals can make changes quickly that curb emissions, and that recent momentum could be used to bring about lasting reductions. However, the extent to which people work from home more frequently, reduce international travel and opt to walk or cycle after the pandemic—and the impact of those actions on emissions—isn’t yet clear. The rebound in emissions indicates that it may be limited, scientists say. There is also pushback from some businesses that don’t want to change their behavior, saying they need to focus on jobs and reviving activity rather than climate objectives. “We see that the forces in both directions are equally strong, and we don’t see yet that this will hasten the energy transition,” DNV’s Mr. Alvik said.

For instance,  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  fell 1% during the 2009 economic downturn but rebounded 6% the following year, according to IEA data, as governments pumped trillions of dollars into their economies to stimulate growth.

Scientists say their newfound ability to rapidly assess changes to  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  could be helpful for future policy. Most of the recent drop in  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  came from surface transport, where activity fell 50%, and industry, where it dropped 35%, according to the report by climate scientists.

      "Sawyer Click/THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Governments have put more effort into reducing  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  since the 2015 Paris climate accord, under which they agreed to limit global temperature increases to less than 2 degrees Celsius, with an ambition to cap them at 1.5 degrees. Since then,  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  have continued to rise, and the U.S. has said it is withdrawing from the deal. Emissions are typically monitored on a monthly and annual basis, but scientists say the pandemic has accelerated efforts to move toward a system of daily reporting. To do that, they are tapping proxy data, such as measuring road traffic via daily requests for driving directions on Apple Inc.’s maps app and TomTom NV statistics, and using data transmitted by smart meters to gauge residential electricity demand. Scientists wanted to measure the impact lockdowns were having on global  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  and how long it would take to return to pre-lockdown levels. “The virus will fundamentally change carbon cycle science, it already has in that we’re focusing on real-time carbon  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP] ,” said Rob Jackson, chair of the Global Carbon Project, which produces annual data focused on  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  from fossil fuels and land use. What do you think the world has learned about carbon  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  during the pandemic? Join the conversation below. “We were struck by how ill-prepared we were to make real-time estimates,” Mr. Jackson said. “What we weren’t as creative about was using [proxy] data sources like cellphone data.” Scientists say that greater use of that data—while not as accurate as more direct sources—has allowed them to track the pace of the fall in  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  and the subsequent rebound. “I think that is useful and sobering for the realization of the challenge,” said Sverre Alvik, program director for energy transition at Norway-based consulting firm DNV GL. The United Nations Environment Programme says global  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  need to fall 7.6% a year until 2030 to be on track to meet the Paris goals.  The world is set to exceed that target this year, with the International Energy Agency forecasting carbon  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  to fall 8% to 30.6 gigatons—the lowest level in a decade. However, many scientists expect the fall to be short-lived given it has been induced by a health crisis rather than a planned, permanent change to  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP] -emitting activities. For instance,  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  fell 1% during the 2009 economic downturn but rebounded 6% the following year, according to IEA data, as governments pumped trillions of dollars into their economies to stimulate growth. This year, governments have committed $12 trillion to reinvigorating economies, with around 5% earmarked for climate-friendly initiatives, according to a report by BloombergNEF in June. Scientists say their newfound ability to rapidly assess changes to  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  could be helpful for future policy. Most of the recent drop in  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  came from surface transport, where activity fell 50%, and industry, where it dropped 35%, according to the report by climate scientists. Aviation saw the largest drop in activity at 75%, but it only generates 2.8% of global  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP] . Ordinarily, the largest contributor to carbon  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  is industrial production at 44%, followed by electricity generation at 22%, and road and rail transport at 21%. “It’s shown us a few of the sectors that are more elastic in the sense that they can be rapidly targeted like transport,” said Richard Allan, professor of climate science at the University of Reading.

There is also pushback from some businesses that don’t want to change their behavior, saying they need to focus on jobs and reviving activity rather than climate objectives. “We see that the forces in both directions are equally strong, and we don’t see yet that this will hasten the energy transition,” DNV’s Mr. Alvik said.

For instance, emissions fell 1% during the 2009 economic downturn but rebounded 6% the following year, according to IEA data, as governments pumped trillions of dollars into their economies to stimulate growth. This year, governments have committed $12 trillion to reinvigorating economies, with around 5% earmarked for  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP] -friendly initiatives, according to a report by BloombergNEF in June. Scientists say their newfound ability to rapidly assess changes to emissions could be helpful for future policy. Most of the recent drop in emissions came from surface transport, where activity fell 50%, and industry, where it dropped 35%, according to the report by  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  scientists. Aviation saw the largest drop in activity at 75%, but it only generates 2.8% of global emissions. Ordinarily, the largest contributor to carbon emissions is industrial production at 44%, followed by electricity generation at 22%, and road and rail transport at 21%. “It’s shown us a few of the sectors that are more elastic in the sense that they can be rapidly targeted like transport,” said Richard Allan, professor of  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  science at the University of Reading.

Scientists also say behavioral shifts during the pandemic have shown that governments, companies and individuals can make changes quickly that curb emissions, and that recent momentum could be used to bring about lasting reductions. However, the extent to which people work from home more frequently, reduce international travel and opt to walk or cycle after the pandemic—and the impact of those actions on emissions—isn’t yet clear. The rebound in emissions indicates that it may be limited, scientists say.

      "Sawyer Click/THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Governments have put more effort into reducing  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  since the 2015 Paris climate accord, under which they agreed to limit global temperature increases to less than 2 degrees Celsius, with an ambition to cap them at 1.5 degrees.

For a lasting impact, governments need to encourage low-emissions technologies such as electric vehicles, she added.

      "Sawyer Click/THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Governments have put more effort into reducing emissions since the 2015 Paris  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  accord, under which they agreed to limit global temperature increases to less than 2 degrees Celsius, with an ambition to cap them at 1.5 degrees. Since then, emissions have continued to rise, and the U.S. has said it is withdrawing from the deal. Emissions are typically monitored on a monthly and annual basis, but scientists say the pandemic has accelerated efforts to move toward a system of daily reporting. To do that, they are tapping proxy data, such as measuring road traffic via daily requests for driving directions on Apple Inc.’s maps app and TomTom NV statistics, and using data transmitted by smart meters to gauge residential electricity demand. Scientists wanted to measure the impact lockdowns were having on global emissions and how long it would take to return to pre-lockdown levels. “The virus will fundamentally change carbon cycle science, it already has in that we’re focusing on real-time carbon emissions,” said Rob Jackson, chair of the Global Carbon Project, which produces annual data focused on emissions from fossil fuels and land use. What do you think the world has learned about carbon emissions during the pandemic? Join the conversation below. “We were struck by how ill-prepared we were to make real-time estimates,” Mr. Jackson said. “What we weren’t as creative about was using [proxy] data sources like cellphone data.” Scientists say that greater use of that data—while not as accurate as more direct sources—has allowed them to track the pace of the fall in emissions and the subsequent rebound. “I think that is useful and sobering for the realization of the challenge,” said Sverre Alvik, program director for energy transition at Norway-based consulting firm DNV GL. The United Nations Environment Programme says global emissions need to fall 7.6% a year until 2030 to be on track to meet the Paris goals.  The world is set to exceed that target this year, with the International Energy Agency forecasting carbon emissions to fall 8% to 30.6 gigatons—the lowest level in a decade. However, many scientists expect the fall to be short-lived given it has been induced by a health crisis rather than a planned, permanent change to emissions-emitting activities. For instance, emissions fell 1% during the 2009 economic downturn but rebounded 6% the following year, according to IEA data, as governments pumped trillions of dollars into their economies to stimulate growth. This year, governments have committed $12 trillion to reinvigorating economies, with around 5% earmarked for  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP] -friendly initiatives, according to a report by BloombergNEF in June. Scientists say their newfound ability to rapidly assess changes to emissions could be helpful for future policy. Most of the recent drop in emissions came from surface transport, where activity fell 50%, and industry, where it dropped 35%, according to the report by  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  scientists. Aviation saw the largest drop in activity at 75%, but it only generates 2.8% of global emissions. Ordinarily, the largest contributor to carbon emissions is industrial production at 44%, followed by electricity generation at 22%, and road and rail transport at 21%. “It’s shown us a few of the sectors that are more elastic in the sense that they can be rapidly targeted like transport,” said Richard Allan, professor of  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  science at the University of Reading.

Scientists also say behavioral shifts during the pandemic have shown that governments, companies and individuals can make changes quickly that curb emissions, and that recent momentum could be used to bring about lasting reductions. However, the extent to which people work from home more frequently, reduce international travel and opt to walk or cycle after the pandemic—and the impact of those actions on emissions—isn’t yet clear. The rebound in emissions indicates that it may be limited, scientists say.

Join the conversation below. “We were struck by how ill-prepared we were to make real-time estimates,” Mr. Jackson said. “What we weren’t as creative about was using [proxy] data sources like cellphone data.” Scientists say that greater use of that data—while not as accurate as more direct sources—has allowed them to track the pace of the fall in emissions and the subsequent rebound. “I think that is useful and sobering for the realization of the challenge,” said Sverre Alvik, program director for energy transition at Norway-based consulting firm DNV GL. The United Nations Environment Programme says global emissions need to fall 7.6% a year until 2030 to be on track to meet the Paris goals.  The world is set to exceed that target this year, with the International Energy Agency forecasting carbon emissions to fall 8% to 30.6 gigatons—the lowest level in a decade. However, many scientists expect the fall to be short-lived given it has been induced by a health crisis rather than a planned, permanent change to emissions-emitting activities. For instance, emissions fell 1% during the 2009 economic downturn but rebounded 6% the following year, according to IEA data, as governments pumped trillions of dollars into their economies to stimulate growth. This year, governments have committed $12 trillion to reinvigorating economies, with around 5% earmarked for  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP] -friendly initiatives, according to a report by BloombergNEF in June. Scientists say their newfound ability to rapidly assess changes to emissions could be helpful for future policy. Most of the recent drop in emissions came from surface transport, where activity fell 50%, and industry, where it dropped 35%, according to the report by  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  scientists. Aviation saw the largest drop in activity at 75%, but it only generates 2.8% of global emissions. Ordinarily, the largest contributor to carbon emissions is industrial production at 44%, followed by electricity generation at 22%, and road and rail transport at 21%. “It’s shown us a few of the sectors that are more elastic in the sense that they can be rapidly targeted like transport,” said Richard Allan, professor of  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  science at the University of Reading.

However, many scientists expect the fall to be short-lived given it has been induced by a health crisis rather than a planned, permanent change to emissions-emitting activities. For instance, emissions fell 1% during the 2009 economic downturn but rebounded 6% the following year, according to IEA data, as governments pumped trillions of dollars into their economies to stimulate growth. This year, governments have committed $12 trillion to reinvigorating economies, with around 5% earmarked for climate-friendly initiatives, according to a report by BloombergNEF in June. Scientists say their newfound ability to rapidly assess changes to emissions could be helpful for future policy. Most of the recent drop in emissions came from surface transport, where activity fell 50%, and industry, where it dropped 35%, according to the report by climate scientists. Aviation saw the largest drop in activity at 75%, but it only generates 2.8% of global emissions. Ordinarily, the largest contributor to carbon emissions is industrial production at 44%, followed by electricity generation at 22%, and road and rail transport at 21%. “It’s shown us a few of the sectors that are more elastic in the sense that they can be rapidly targeted like transport,” said Richard Allan, professor of climate science at the University of Reading.

Scientists also say behavioral shifts during the pandemic have shown that governments, companies and individuals can make changes quickly that curb emissions, and that recent momentum could be used to bring about lasting reductions. However, the extent to which people work from home more frequently, reduce international travel and opt to walk or cycle after the pandemic—and the impact of those actions on emissions—isn’t yet clear. The rebound in emissions indicates that it may be limited, scientists say. There is also pushback from some businesses that don’t want to change their behavior, saying they need to focus on jobs and reviving activity rather than climate objectives. “We see that the forces in both directions are equally strong, and we don’t see yet that this will hasten the energy transition,” DNV’s Mr. Alvik said.

For instance,  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  fell 1% during the 2009 economic downturn but rebounded 6% the following year, according to IEA data, as governments pumped trillions of dollars into their economies to stimulate growth.

Scientists say their newfound ability to rapidly assess changes to  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  could be helpful for future policy. Most of the recent drop in  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  came from surface transport, where activity fell 50%, and industry, where it dropped 35%, according to the report by climate scientists.

      "Sawyer Click/THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Governments have put more effort into reducing  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  since the 2015 Paris climate accord, under which they agreed to limit global temperature increases to less than 2 degrees Celsius, with an ambition to cap them at 1.5 degrees. Since then,  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  have continued to rise, and the U.S. has said it is withdrawing from the deal. Emissions are typically monitored on a monthly and annual basis, but scientists say the pandemic has accelerated efforts to move toward a system of daily reporting. To do that, they are tapping proxy data, such as measuring road traffic via daily requests for driving directions on Apple Inc.’s maps app and TomTom NV statistics, and using data transmitted by smart meters to gauge residential electricity demand. Scientists wanted to measure the impact lockdowns were having on global  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  and how long it would take to return to pre-lockdown levels. “The virus will fundamentally change carbon cycle science, it already has in that we’re focusing on real-time carbon  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP] ,” said Rob Jackson, chair of the Global Carbon Project, which produces annual data focused on  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  from fossil fuels and land use. What do you think the world has learned about carbon  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  during the pandemic? Join the conversation below. “We were struck by how ill-prepared we were to make real-time estimates,” Mr. Jackson said. “What we weren’t as creative about was using [proxy] data sources like cellphone data.” Scientists say that greater use of that data—while not as accurate as more direct sources—has allowed them to track the pace of the fall in  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  and the subsequent rebound. “I think that is useful and sobering for the realization of the challenge,” said Sverre Alvik, program director for energy transition at Norway-based consulting firm DNV GL. The United Nations Environment Programme says global  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  need to fall 7.6% a year until 2030 to be on track to meet the Paris goals.  The world is set to exceed that target this year, with the International Energy Agency forecasting carbon  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  to fall 8% to 30.6 gigatons—the lowest level in a decade. However, many scientists expect the fall to be short-lived given it has been induced by a health crisis rather than a planned, permanent change to  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP] -emitting activities. For instance,  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  fell 1% during the 2009 economic downturn but rebounded 6% the following year, according to IEA data, as governments pumped trillions of dollars into their economies to stimulate growth. This year, governments have committed $12 trillion to reinvigorating economies, with around 5% earmarked for climate-friendly initiatives, according to a report by BloombergNEF in June. Scientists say their newfound ability to rapidly assess changes to  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  could be helpful for future policy. Most of the recent drop in  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  came from surface transport, where activity fell 50%, and industry, where it dropped 35%, according to the report by climate scientists. Aviation saw the largest drop in activity at 75%, but it only generates 2.8% of global  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP] . Ordinarily, the largest contributor to carbon  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  is industrial production at 44%, followed by electricity generation at 22%, and road and rail transport at 21%. “It’s shown us a few of the sectors that are more elastic in the sense that they can be rapidly targeted like transport,” said Richard Allan, professor of climate science at the University of Reading.

There is also pushback from some businesses that don’t want to change their behavior, saying they need to focus on jobs and reviving activity rather than climate objectives. “We see that the forces in both directions are equally strong, and we don’t see yet that this will hasten the energy transition,” DNV’s Mr. Alvik said.

For instance, emissions fell 1% during the 2009 economic downturn but rebounded 6% the following year, according to IEA data, as governments pumped trillions of dollars into their economies to stimulate growth. This year, governments have committed $12 trillion to reinvigorating economies, with around 5% earmarked for  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP] -friendly initiatives, according to a report by BloombergNEF in June. Scientists say their newfound ability to rapidly assess changes to emissions could be helpful for future policy. Most of the recent drop in emissions came from surface transport, where activity fell 50%, and industry, where it dropped 35%, according to the report by  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  scientists. Aviation saw the largest drop in activity at 75%, but it only generates 2.8% of global emissions. Ordinarily, the largest contributor to carbon emissions is industrial production at 44%, followed by electricity generation at 22%, and road and rail transport at 21%. “It’s shown us a few of the sectors that are more elastic in the sense that they can be rapidly targeted like transport,” said Richard Allan, professor of  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  science at the University of Reading. Select breaking and enterprise stories about energy markets and businesses, through news alerts delivered to you via email. Scientists also say behavioral shifts during the pandemic have shown that governments, companies and individuals can make changes quickly that curb emissions, and that recent momentum could be used to bring about lasting reductions. However, the extent to which people work from home more frequently, reduce international travel and opt to walk or cycle after the pandemic—and the impact of those actions on emissions—isn’t yet clear. The rebound in emissions indicates that it may be limited, scientists say. There is also pushback from some businesses that don’t want to change their behavior, saying they need to focus on jobs and reviving activity rather than  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  [B-ASP]climate change[E-ASP]  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP] . Emissions sank when factories were shut down, planes grounded and cars parked, as people stayed home to slow the spread of the coronavirus, but they are now rebounding fast as economies reopen. When two-thirds of the world’s population was under lockdown in early April, carbon  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  were down 17% compared with average daily  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  last year, according to a study by a group of climate scientists published in the journal Nature Climate Change. By June 11, the drop was 5%. “We’re getting to this by stopping all activities, not structural changes, so when people go back to work there’s no reason these  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  wouldn’t go shooting back up,” said Corinne Le Quéré, a professor of climate change science and policy at the U.K.’s University of East Anglia, who led the study. For a lasting impact, governments need to encourage low- [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  technologies such as electric vehicles, she added.

      "Sawyer Click/THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Governments have put more effort into reducing  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  since the 2015 Paris climate accord, under which they agreed to limit global temperature increases to less than 2 degrees Celsius, with an ambition to cap them at 1.5 degrees. Since then,  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  have continued to rise, and the U.S. has said it is withdrawing from the deal. Emissions are typically monitored on a monthly and annual basis, but scientists say the pandemic has accelerated efforts to move toward a system of daily reporting. To do that, they are tapping proxy data, such as measuring road traffic via daily requests for driving directions on Apple Inc.’s maps app and TomTom NV statistics, and using data transmitted by smart meters to gauge residential electricity demand. Scientists wanted to measure the impact lockdowns were having on global  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  and how long it would take to return to pre-lockdown levels. “The virus will fundamentally change carbon cycle science, it already has in that we’re focusing on real-time carbon  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP] ,” said Rob Jackson, chair of the Global Carbon Project, which produces annual data focused on  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  from fossil fuels and land use. What do you think the world has learned about carbon  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  during the pandemic? Join the conversation below. “We were struck by how ill-prepared we were to make real-time estimates,” Mr. Jackson said. “What we weren’t as creative about was using [proxy] data sources like cellphone data.” Scientists say that greater use of that data—while not as accurate as more direct sources—has allowed them to track the pace of the fall in  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  and the subsequent rebound. “I think that is useful and sobering for the realization of the challenge,” said Sverre Alvik, program director for energy transition at Norway-based consulting firm DNV GL. The United Nations Environment Programme says global  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  need to fall 7.6% a year until 2030 to be on track to meet the Paris goals.  The world is set to exceed that target this year, with the International Energy Agency forecasting carbon  [B-ASP]emissions[E-ASP]  to fall 8% to 30.6 gigatons—the lowest level in a decade.

It raises a huge question, however: How much of this outward-looking, free-market future would be politically achievable? The issues boil down to these. Would the U.K. be able to improve on the trade agreements that it currently has within the EU and that the bloc has with non-EU countries? And would it be possible, post “Brexit,” to push a bonfire of employment,  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  and other regulations through Parliament in London? On both scores, there is room for hesitation.  There is no doubt that the EU is responsible for large swaths of regulation that affect the British economy. The EU “has increasingly become a force for heavy-handed and petty regulation rather than for free-market liberalism,” Mark Littlewood of the free-market Institute of Economic Affairs said last month. Surveys of U.K. businesses regularly show that overregulation is a strong concern, and that the EU has contributed significantly to it. There is a limit, however, to how far Europe has forced the U.K.’s unwilling hand. Data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show the U.K. has the second-freest product markets among 54 countries it sampled, after the Netherlands, another EU country. As for labor-market flexibility, it is the most flexible economy in Europe, slightly less flexible than Canada but more so than Australia. The think tank Open Europe has estimated that the 100 most expensive EU-derived regulations cost the U.K. economy about £33.3 billion ($47 billion) a year. (The benefits, calculated from government data, exceed this.) Paring these regulations back could save £12.8 billion a year, or 0.7% of gross domestic product. Some £5.8 billion of this saving could come from softening environment and  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP] -change laws, for example, by scrapping targets for renewable energy and pulling out of the EU emissions-trading system. Another promising contender: employment, social and health-and-safety laws. Here, it estimated £5.6 billion could feasibly be saved by, among other things, scrapping EU laws involving temporary-employment agencies and reining in the directive on working time. But as Open Europe pointed out in its report this week, these steps “will involve politically challenging decisions and may also mean shifting the trend of domestic policy.” Doing it will also mean limiting the level of economic integration with the EU, because the closer a country is tied to the bloc, the more of its rules it has to accept. On  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  change, deregulation would involve a change of direction for the U.K., which “has gone further than EU standards and continues to do so,” the report said. Pushing through those decisions would be even more challenging because the main opposition Labour Party has abandoned the pro-business stance it took in government from 1997 to 2010. And the Scottish Nationalists, now an important force in London, also favor strong state intervention. Jeremy Corbyn, Labour’s new leader, laid out Thursday what he called “the strong socialist case” for staying in the EU.

On trade, Open Europe’s analysis questions too the openness of the economy, suggesting that immediately after exit, U.K.’s trade in goods and services will be less free than it is now. That is in part because the U.K. would likely lose its membership of the EU single market. The price of accepting insider status in the single market from outside the bloc would likely be too high: accepting EU regulation without getting a vote on it, and acceding to free movement of EU workers—the issue over which many people will vote to leave. The other reason is that negotiating free-trade deals with non-EU countries would take many years. These agreements might eventually be broader in scope than those the EU currently has. But the more extensive a free-trade agreement, the longer the time needed usually to negotiate them. And as current worries about the impact on British industry of cheap Chinese steel show, free trade isn’t always popular. One further attribute of an open, outward-facing economy is openness to immigration, which economists say helps maintain a flexible supply of labor. Outside the EU, the U.K. should be able to implement selective immigration policies that would be less open to EU workers and more open to the rest of the world. That could be economically beneficial and more politically acceptable than now, Open Europe concluded. But net immigration is likely to remain high whether the U.K. stays in or leaves the EU. The U.K.’s economic path after leaving the EU would be critically shaped by the political decisions that follow.

But as Open Europe pointed out in its report this week, these steps “will involve politically challenging decisions and may also mean shifting the trend of domestic policy.” Doing it will also mean limiting the level of economic integration with the EU, because the closer a country is tied to the bloc, the more of its rules it has to accept.

On trade, Open Europe’s analysis questions too the openness of the economy, suggesting that immediately after exit, U.K.’s trade in goods and services will be less free than it is now. That is in part because the U.K. would likely lose its membership of the EU single market. The price of accepting insider status in the single market from outside the bloc would likely be too high: accepting EU regulation without getting a vote on it, and acceding to free movement of EU workers—the issue over which many people will vote to leave. The other reason is that negotiating free-trade deals with non-EU countries would take many years. These agreements might eventually be broader in scope than those the EU currently has. But the more extensive a free-trade agreement, the longer the time needed usually to negotiate them. And as current worries about the impact on British industry of cheap Chinese steel show, free trade isn’t always popular. One further attribute of an open, outward-facing economy is openness to immigration, which economists say helps maintain a flexible supply of labor. Outside the EU, the U.K. should be able to implement selective immigration policies that would be less open to EU workers and more open to the rest of the world. That could be economically beneficial and more politically acceptable than now, Open Europe concluded. But net immigration is likely to remain high whether the U.K. stays in or leaves the EU. The U.K.’s economic path after leaving the EU would be critically shaped by the political decisions that follow.

      "[2023-05-18 12:47:01] (2.3.1) Warning: reference sentiment does not exist or its number 0 is not equal to aspect number 8, text:  It is a vision laid out by many supporters of Britain’s departure from the European Union: a dynamic economy freed of the shackles imposed by the dead hand of regulation from Brussels. It raises a huge question, however: How much of this outward-looking, free-market future would be politically achievable? The issues boil down to these. Would the U.K. be able to improve on the trade agreements that it currently has within the EU and that the bloc has with non-EU countries? And would it be possible, post “Brexit,” to push a bonfire of employment,  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  and other regulations through Parliament in London? On both scores, there is room for hesitation.  There is no doubt that the EU is responsible for large swaths of regulation that affect the British economy. The EU “has increasingly become a force for heavy-handed and petty regulation rather than for free-market liberalism,” Mark Littlewood of the free-market Institute of Economic Affairs said last month. Surveys of U.K. businesses regularly show that overregulation is a strong concern, and that the EU has contributed significantly to it. There is a limit, however, to how far Europe has forced the U.K.’s unwilling hand. Data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show the U.K. has the second-freest product markets among 54 countries it sampled, after the Netherlands, another EU country. As for labor-market flexibility, it is the most flexible economy in Europe, slightly less flexible than Canada but more so than Australia. The think tank Open Europe has estimated that the 100 most expensive EU-derived regulations cost the U.K. economy about £33.3 billion ($47 billion) a year. (The benefits, calculated from government data, exceed this.) Paring these regulations back could save £12.8 billion a year, or 0.7% of gross domestic product. Some £5.8 billion of this saving could come from softening environment and  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP] -change laws, for example, by scrapping targets for renewable energy and pulling out of the EU emissions-trading system. Another promising contender: employment, social and health-and-safety laws. Here, it estimated £5.6 billion could feasibly be saved by, among other things, scrapping EU laws involving temporary-employment agencies and reining in the directive on working time. But as Open Europe pointed out in its report this week, these steps “will involve politically challenging decisions and may also mean shifting the trend of domestic policy.” Doing it will also mean limiting the level of economic integration with the EU, because the closer a country is tied to the bloc, the more of its rules it has to accept. On  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  change, deregulation would involve a change of direction for the U.K., which “has gone further than EU standards and continues to do so,” the report said. Pushing through those decisions would be even more challenging because the main opposition Labour Party has abandoned the pro-business stance it took in government from 1997 to 2010. And the Scottish Nationalists, now an important force in London, also favor strong state intervention. Jeremy Corbyn, Labour’s new leader, laid out Thursday what he called “the strong socialist case” for staying in the EU. A key part of the argument was that the EU provided a bulwark against right-wing efforts to undermine workers’ rights, to go easy on tax dodgers and to ignore the perils of  [B-ASP]climate[E-ASP]  [B-ASP]climate change[E-ASP] , deregulation would involve a change of direction for the U.K., which “has gone further than EU standards and continues to do so,” the report said.

A key part of the argument was that the EU provided a bulwark against right-wing efforts to undermine workers’ rights, to go easy on tax dodgers and to ignore the perils of climate change. “The free-market enthusiasts in the Leave campaign would put all those protections at risk,” he said. On trade, Open Europe’s analysis questions too the openness of the economy, suggesting that immediately after exit, U.K.’s trade in goods and services will be less free than it is now. That is in part because the U.K. would likely lose its membership of the EU single market. The price of accepting insider status in the single market from outside the bloc would likely be too high: accepting EU regulation without getting a vote on it, and acceding to free movement of EU workers—the issue over which many people will vote to leave. The other reason is that negotiating free-trade deals with non-EU countries would take many years. These agreements might eventually be broader in scope than those the EU currently has. But the more extensive a free-trade agreement, the longer the time needed usually to negotiate them. And as current worries about the impact on British industry of cheap Chinese steel show, free trade isn’t always popular. One further attribute of an open, outward-facing economy is openness to immigration, which economists say helps maintain a flexible supply of labor. Outside the EU, the U.K. should be able to implement selective immigration policies that would be less open to EU workers and more open to the rest of the world. That could be economically beneficial and more politically acceptable than now, Open Europe concluded. But net immigration is likely to remain high whether the U.K. stays in or leaves the EU.

       "['More than a dozen state attorneys general gathered in New York earlier this week, ostensibly to announce their support for President Obama’s efforts to combat global warming and to underscore their intention to collaborate on investigations involving climate-related issues.\\nWant to know how your actions can help make a difference for our planet? Sign up for the Climate Coach newsletter, in your inbox every Tuesday and Thursday.\\nBut the undercurrent of Tuesday’s public announcement, which included former vice president and climate activist Al Gore taking a turn at the podium, was anything but subtle: New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and his counterparts from around the country vowed to “collectively, collaboratively and aggressively” investigate whether fossil fuel companies such as ExxonMobil have misled shareholders and the public about what they knew — and when — about the risks of climate change.\\n“We have heard the scientists; we know what’s happening to the planet,” Schneiderman said. “But there is confusion, sowed by those with an interest in profiting from the confusion and creating misperceptions in the eyes of the American public.”\\nAdvertisement\\nSchneiderman began investigating ExxonMobil last fall, subpoenaing documents from the company in the wake of reporting by the Los Angeles Times and the online publication Inside Climate News that showed Exxon’s in-house researchers were concerned about climate change from fossil-fuel emissions decades ago, and yet for a long time, the company publicly raised doubts about the science. \\\\\\nSchneiderman has leeway to undertake such an investigation under both consumer protection laws and New York’s Martin Act, a securities law that protects investors.\\nNew York is investigating Exxon Mobil for allegedly misleading the public about climate change\\nThe California attorney general’s office has since initiated its own investigation, and on Tuesday, at least two more attorneys general — Maura Healey of Massachusetts and Claude Walker of the Virgin Islands — said they also had opened inquiries into Exxon’s actions.\\nAdvertisement\\nSuzanne McCarron, ExxonMobil’s vice president of public and government affairs, said in a statement that the accusations against the company are “politically motivated and based on discredited reporting funded by activist organizations” and that ExxonMobil is “actively assessing all legal options.”\\nShe added that the allegations are “preposterous” and “based on the false premise that ExxonMobil reached definitive conclusions about anthropogenic climate change before the world’s experts and before the science itself had matured, and then withheld it from the broader scientific community.” McCarron said the company openly shared findings in peer-reviewed publications and actively contributed to the work of the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\\n“The allegations repeated today are an attempt to limit free speech and are the antithesis of scientific inquiry,” McCarron said. “Left unchallenged, they could stifle the search for solutions to the real risks from climate change.”\\nAdvertisement\\nWhile ExxonMobil might have been the company publicly in the crosshairs this week, the carefully coordinated announcement in New York could signal the beginning stages of a broader reckoning for big energy companies facing questions about what they knew about climate change, and when.\\nAt least Gore seemed to think so.\\nYears from now, the former vice president insisted, the convening of this group of state law enforcement officials will be viewed as “a real turning point” in the efforts to hold to account companies that have deceived investors and the public about climate change. He went as far as to liken the effort to similar action taken decades ago against the tobacco industry, which despite growing health warnings long denied the harmful nature of its products, until state attorneys general led the way in forcing the industry to acknowledge it had known of the potential dangers all along.\\nREAD MORE:\\nScientists nearly double sea level rise projections for 2100, because of Antarctica\\nEven ExxonMobil says climate change is real.

       " \" When Carmen Luna moved to a neighborhood on the outskirts of Mexico City in 1975, there was no sewage system. To get water, she carried buckets to and from a faucet in the street. At the end of the 1980s, her house was connected to the grid; her family would get tamarind-colored water three days a week. Last year, Ms. Luna signed up for a new rainwater-harvesting program led by Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum, an environmental scientist. The city government had teamed up with local nonprofit Isla Urbana to install 100,000 of its rainwater-harvesting systems in the districts of Xochimilco and Iztapalapa. Today, 20% of the water used in Ms. Luna’s eight-member household comes from a 2,500-liter collection tank on the ground floor. While not potable, the water is available seven days a week and can be used for household chores and bathing, easing strain on the grid. Harvesting rainwater is a centuries-old practice, but Isla Urbana’s system is cheaper, faster and easier to install than most existing technology. A look at how innovation and technology are transforming the way we live, work and play. The coronavirus pandemic, which has shut down much of Mexico City for months, has only heightened the need for access to quality water in the home, including for hand washing. Even before the current crisis, however, cities were struggling to provide running water to their inhabitants. According to the United Nations, Mexico City, Cairo, Bangalore, and seven other megalopolises will likely run out of water by 2030. These cities grew exponentially at the end of the 20th century, and governments couldn't keep up in building centralized infrastructure. Climate change will only exacerbate this situation, with more erratic rainfall and hotter temperatures more quickly evaporating water in reservoirs, according to a recent U.N. report. “Mexico City’s case is tragic because, unlike other cities, it is located on a region where water abounds,” says Manuel Perló, an urbanist and sociologist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico who specializes in water resources. The city receives more yearly rainfall than London. But the resource has been mismanaged, Mr. Perló says. Most of the city’s water is pumped from dams up to 125 miles away, and 40% is lost through leaks in pipes and containers, according to Mr. Perló. In Mexico City, when it rains, it storms, but the water mixes with the sewage and cannot be used. Since the late 1990s, places such as Australia and Santa Fe, N.M., have made it compulsory for new residences to have rainwater-harvesting systems. Brazil has installed 650,000 systems in the semiarid northern region, according to Johann Gnadlinger, a water-resource engineer who worked on the project. In 2015, China launched its Sponge City initiative to install permeable pavement to absorb rainwater before it hits the sewers. Today, 2% to 3% of the world’s population collects rainwater to use for chores, but that could rise to 8% by 2030, according to Han Heijen, president of the International Rainwater Harvesting Alliance, a Swiss nongovernmental organization. Whether rainwater collection can be a viable part of long-term water-supply solutions depends on the success of experiments such as Isla Urbana’s. The nonprofit’s system costs $750 on average, and it takes about an afternoon to put in. It is made of PVC plastic, and no specialized knowledge is needed to install it, Isla Urbana says. By contrast, a standard rainwater harvesting system for a typical single-family home would generally cost between $8,000 and $10,000, according to the Texas Water Development Board, a state agency. In Isla Urbana’s system, pipes collect water from the roof. First, leaves and debris are filtered out. Then the water goes through a patented filter called the Tlaloque 200 before being collected in a tank. The Tlaloque is based on the “first flush,” the idea that water from an initial rainfall is more contaminated because it washes away surface dirt and organisms. First-flush filters are an integral part of many rainwater-harvesting systems. The final output isn’t potable water, but it can be used for cleaning, laundry, toilets and showers. A purifier and carbon filter can be added to make the water potable and better tasting. It remains to be seen how durable the system is—an important consideration because maintenance is crucial for good water quality. Mr. Gnadlinger says that the Brazil system, which was made of cement, could last dozens of years. The main parts of Isla Urbana’s system can last 30 years, says co-founder David Vargas. One obstacle to broader global implementation of rainwater harvesting is the belief by citizens, health officials and utilities that it is less hygienic than centralized city water systems. Could Mexico City be a model for other cities working to provide clean water to their inhabitants? Join the conversation below. And what if it doesn’t rain? Cities tend to be warmer and wetter than their surrounding areas, making them ideal for rainwater collection. But in the future, rainfall patterns in certain regions could become harder to predict, according to a 2016 article published in the journal Nature. Even in Mexico City, it may be challenging to expand the Isla Urbana system because of uneven rainfall, says Mr. Perló. Some months are wet, most are dry. “Five to six great storms could account for 50% of rainwater precipitation during the whole year, but it isn’t so easy to predict where they will fall,” he says. Brazil may offer clues. In the state of Bahia, the dry season lasts at least eight months. Since 2012, a semi-drought has affected the region, heavily changing rain patterns. In 2017, rainfall was a fifth of the yearly average. The harvesting systems constructed before the drought caught the little rain that there was, meaning that people had water at least part of the time, Mr. Gnadlinger says. (Government-run emergency water trucks also filled in.) “The main reason why planners disregard rainwater harvesting is that it is not reliable in terms of a perennial supply,” says Mr. Heijen of the International Rainwater Harvesting Alliance. In the future, as the weather gets less predictable, households in some parts of the world may need to get used to having different sources of water in different seasons. “To be a good engineer during the last century was to find an optimal solution to a definable problem,” says Alex Steffen, a San Francisco-based writer and consultant focused on climate change. “Instead of seeking the most optimal solution, we need the most rugged, the one that withstands pressure.”  \",\n",
       " 'As ocean warming continues to trigger widespread destruction of coral reefs, a decade-long study of remote islands in the Central Pacific suggests these biodiversity hot spots may nonetheless be able to thrive.\\nWith many parts of the globe in the grip of a coral reef bleaching event — fueled in part by El Niño-driven ocean warming — scientists and marine conservation advocates have feared many reefs could suffer irreparable damage and fade from existence in coming decades.\\nA new report from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California at San Diego provides reason for optimism by highlighting the potential for preservation efforts. In a massive project spanning 56 islands, researchers documented 450 coral reef locations from Hawaii to American Samoa.\\nThe results show that coral reefs surrounding remote islands were dramatically healthier than those in populated areas that were subject to a variety of human impacts.\\n“There are still coral reefs on this planet that are incredibly healthy and probably look the way they did 1,000 years ago,” said Jennifer Smith, lead author of the study and a professor at Scripps’s Center for Marine Biodiversity and Conservation.\\n“The scientists were practically in tears when we saw some of these reefs,” she added. “We’ve never experienced anything like it in our lives. It was an almost religious experience.”\\n[Here’s what a scientist is doing to create corals that can survive warm seas]\\nTeeming with sharks, manta rays, jellyfish and sea turtles, these remote locations contrasted starkly with the heavily populated areas, which were encircled by coral reefs covered in murky seaweed and lacking much of the colorful algae that helps to cement a reef.\\nIn recent decades, coral reef ecosystems worldwide have suffered significantly from overfishing, coastal development and the dumping of toxic substances into ocean waters. Scientists have predicted that up to 70 percent of coral reefs could be lost by mid-century.\\nOccupying less than a tenth of 1 percent of the ocean’s sea floor, coral reefs are estimated to be home to nearly a quarter of all marine species. They also provide several human benefits, including food, tourism and flood protection for coastline developments.\\nThe new study may catalyze preservation efforts, which some have viewed as futile, said Stephanie Wear, senior scientist for the coral reef conservation program at the Nature Conservancy.\\n“I think it can energize people who are responsible for managing [reefs] that what they’re doing really does matter,” she said. “There are certainly people out there who have said, ‘There’s no point; climate change is going to be the end of reefs,’ and I absolutely disagree with that.”\\nStill, localized efforts to safeguard coral reefs probably will only stave off the worst impacts of global warming for so long, said Nancy Knowlton, a coral reef biologist and holder of the Smithsonian Institution’s Sant Chair for Marine Science.\\n“The question is: ‘How long will reefs be able to stay healthy in the context of much more frequent warming events and ocean acidification?’\\u2009” said Knowlton, who previously worked at Scripps and participated in the coral reef project’s initial research. “I think most reef scientists will say there are limits.”\\n“What this study shows is that protection in a variety of different ways buys us incredibly valuable time while we figure out how to deal with the threat posed by climate change,” she added.\\n— San Diego Union-Tribune\\nRead:\\nThe amazing fish and corals of the Great Barrier Reef are under siege\\nWhat happens to a coral reef when someone builds an island on top?\\nBleaching and disease are devastating the biggest coral reef in the continental U.S.\\nRead more:\\nThe amazing fish and corals of the Great Barrier Reef are under siege\\nWhat happens to a coral reef when someone builds an island on top?\\nBleaching and disease are devastating the biggest coral reef in the continental U.S.',\n",
       " ' PG&E Corp. told California regulators that its power equipment might have contributed to igniting a recent wildfire that has killed four people. The utility disclosed in securities filings that it notified the California Public Utilities Commission on Friday it had recorded alarms on certain equipment supporting a power line that served an area east of Redding, Calif., where the Zogg Fire is believed to have originated in Shasta County, near Oregon. The fire has burned more than 56,000 acres and destroyed 204 structures since it started late last month, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The blaze, which forced evacuations in the area, was almost fully contained as of Friday, according to Cal Fire. PG&E said state fire investigators have taken possession of some of its equipment as part of their probe into the cause of the fire. The company said the information is preliminary and that it has no information about the cause of the fire. It said it doesn’t have access to Cal Fire evidence and that it is cooperating with the investigation. “We recognize the tragic losses sustained as a result of this year’s fire season and are thankful as always for the efforts of the first responders who have worked tirelessly to contain the fires and protect the lives and property of California residents,” the company said. If PG&E’s equipment is found responsible for the fire, it could face substantial liability-related costs just months after emerging from bankruptcy. The company sought chapter 11 protection in January 2019 as it grappled with billions of dollars in wildfire-related liability costs. The company’s equipment sparked a series of destructive wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that collectively killed more than 100 people and burned more than 15,000 homes in Northern California. PG&E has been working to make its electric grid safer and trim trees away from power lines to reduce the risk of its equipment sparking more wildfires. The company has resorted to pre-emptively shutting off power when wind speeds pick up, which raises fire risks. California has suffered an unprecedented spate of wildfires this year. More than 3.8 million acres have been scorched by a total of more than 8,100 fires, according to Cal Fire. Since mid-August, at least 29 people have died. Severe weather conditions have given rise to the blazes in California and across the western U.S., with record-setting heat, gusty winds and dry vegetation fueling fast-spreading blazes. Scientists say the most significant causes are poor forest management and climate change, which causes higher temperatures and longer droughts.

       " ' The world’s top central banks can do more to adapt their monetary policies to help mitigate climate-change risks without giving up on their other goals such as curbing inflation and boosting the economy, according to a new research paper. Central banks can contribute based on the kinds of securities they buy in support of their stimulus efforts, says a Peterson Institute for International Economics paper written by Patrick Honohan, a fellow at the institute. “If central banks applied to their own bond purchases the new approach to climate-related financial risk that they are pressing on private bankers, they would reduce their purchases of bonds issued by carbon-intensive firms,” Mr. Honohan wrote in the paper made public Tuesday. Mr. Honohan’s recommendations mostly apply to central banks other than the Federal Reserve. The Fed is limited by law in what securities it can buy. The Fed can only buy Treasurys, agencies and mortgages and strongly favors government securities. But other central banks, such as the European Central Bank, have more latitude in what they can acquire, giving them an additional tool to help the broader effort of reducing climate change risks. The world’s biggest central banks buy bonds to help achieve monetary-policy goals. In the financial crisis and its aftermath, central banks supercharged these purchases as a tool to provide stimulus. This strategy is expected to be replayed in future recessions, and some central banks such as the ECB and the Bank of Japan are already amassing securities to aid their economies The Fed’s monetary-policy choices are aimed squarely at achieving the inflation and job growth goals set out for it by Congress. The U.S. central bank is a lone holdout among the world’s biggest central banks in the Network for Greening the Financial System, a global effort aimed at preparing the financial system to deal with climate change risks. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said earlier this month that climate change is “absolute first-order issue as far as I’m concerned.” But, “the main responsibility for climate change now—dealing with climate change—resides with legislatures and particular agencies that are focused on the economy,” he said, adding that “we’re not in a place where I think we would conduct monetary policy in order to deal with climate change type issues.” The Fed has dealt with climate change through the prism of its regulatory authority. It has acknowledged that as part of its stress testing of banks it seeks to ensure that regulated financial institutions are ready to deal with “severe weather.” Top Fed leaders have, however, been careful not to wade into climate change issues more deeply in a political environment where some Republicans have questioned whether the use of fossil fuels is boosting overall global temperatures. The Fed has produced research that shows if nothing is done to alter current trends, economic growth is likely to take a big hit. “In coming decades, climate change—and efforts to limit that change and adapt to it—will have increasingly important effects on the U.S. economy,” wrote Glenn Rudebusch, an economist and executive vice president at the San Francisco Fed, in research released over spring. A Richmond Fed report from 2018 said growth would be significantly reduced if temperatures rise along the path scientists currently believe is likely. Write to Michael S.

       " ' For climate scientists, the pandemic has made one thing clearer: the difficulty of reducing carbon emissions. Emissions sank when factories were shut down, planes grounded and cars parked, as people stayed home to slow the spread of the coronavirus, but they are now rebounding fast as economies reopen. When two-thirds of the world’s population was under lockdown in early April, carbon emissions were down 17% compared with average daily emissions last year, according to a study by a group of climate scientists published in the journal Nature Climate Change. By June 11, the drop was 5%. “We’re getting to this by stopping all activities, not structural changes, so when people go back to work there’s no reason these emissions wouldn’t go shooting back up,” said Corinne Le Quéré, a professor of climate change science and policy at the U.K.’s University of East Anglia, who led the study. For a lasting impact, governments need to encourage low-emissions technologies such as electric vehicles, she added.                                                 No policies to reduce emissions 4.1 - 4.8°C rise in temp. 150 Gigatonnes of CO2 100 Current policies 2.8 - 3.2°C 50 Pledged reductions 2.8°C Historical 0 Paris agreement 2.0°C -25 1990 2010 2030 2050 2070 2090                         Source: Climate Action Tracker\\nSawyer Click/THE WALL STREET JOURNAL Governments have put more effort into reducing emissions since the 2015 Paris climate accord, under which they agreed to limit global temperature increases to less than 2 degrees Celsius, with an ambition to cap them at 1.5 degrees. Since then, emissions have continued to rise, and the U.S. has said it is withdrawing from the deal. Emissions are typically monitored on a monthly and annual basis, but scientists say the pandemic has accelerated efforts to move toward a system of daily reporting. To do that, they are tapping proxy data, such as measuring road traffic via daily requests for driving directions on Apple Inc.’s maps app and TomTom NV statistics, and using data transmitted by smart meters to gauge residential electricity demand. Scientists wanted to measure the impact lockdowns were having on global emissions and how long it would take to return to pre-lockdown levels. “The virus will fundamentally change carbon cycle science, it already has in that we’re focusing on real-time carbon emissions,” said Rob Jackson, chair of the Global Carbon Project, which produces annual data focused on emissions from fossil fuels and land use. What do you think the world has learned about carbon emissions during the pandemic? Join the conversation below. “We were struck by how ill-prepared we were to make real-time estimates,” Mr. Jackson said. “What we weren’t as creative about was using [proxy] data sources like cellphone data.” Scientists say that greater use of that data—while not as accurate as more direct sources—has allowed them to track the pace of the fall in emissions and the subsequent rebound. “I think that is useful and sobering for the realization of the challenge,” said Sverre Alvik, program director for energy transition at Norway-based consulting firm DNV GL. The United Nations Environment Programme says global emissions need to fall 7.6% a year until 2030 to be on track to meet the Paris goals.  The world is set to exceed that target this year, with the International Energy Agency forecasting carbon emissions to fall 8% to 30.6 gigatons—the lowest level in a decade. However, many scientists expect the fall to be short-lived given it has been induced by a health crisis rather than a planned, permanent change to emissions-emitting activities. For instance, emissions fell 1% during the 2009 economic downturn but rebounded 6% the following year, according to IEA data, as governments pumped trillions of dollars into their economies to stimulate growth. This year, governments have committed $12 trillion to reinvigorating economies, with around 5% earmarked for climate-friendly initiatives, according to a report by BloombergNEF in June. Scientists say their newfound ability to rapidly assess changes to emissions could be helpful for future policy. Most of the recent drop in emissions came from surface transport, where activity fell 50%, and industry, where it dropped 35%, according to the report by climate scientists. Aviation saw the largest drop in activity at 75%, but it only generates 2.8% of global emissions. Ordinarily, the largest contributor to carbon emissions is industrial production at 44%, followed by electricity generation at 22%, and road and rail transport at 21%. “It’s shown us a few of the sectors that are more elastic in the sense that they can be rapidly targeted like transport,” said Richard Allan, professor of climate science at the University of Reading. Select breaking and enterprise stories about energy markets and businesses, through news alerts delivered to you via email. Scientists also say behavioral shifts during the pandemic have shown that governments, companies and individuals can make changes quickly that curb emissions, and that recent momentum could be used to bring about lasting reductions. However, the extent to which people work from home more frequently, reduce international travel and opt to walk or cycle after the pandemic—and the impact of those actions on emissions—isn’t yet clear. The rebound in emissions indicates that it may be limited, scientists say. There is also pushback from some businesses that don’t want to change their behavior, saying they need to focus on jobs and reviving activity rather than climate objectives. “We see that the forces in both directions are equally strong, and we don’t see yet that this will hasten the energy transition,” DNV’s Mr. Alvik said.

       " ' Liberals criticize President Trump for politicizing the Federal Reserve, and not without cause, but then they demand that the central bank exercise its vast powers against climate change. Credit to Fed Chairman Jay Powell for telling Congress that climate stability isn’t part of its mandate. “Climate change is an important issue but not principally for the Fed,” Mr. Powell told the Joint Economic Committee this week. “We’re not going to be the ones to decide society’s response. That is for elected officials, not us.” This matters because other central bankers have been all too happy to join the climate-change virtue parade. The European Central Bank has bought “green” bonds financing renewable energy, though environmentalists also want it to ditch assets in fossil-fuel companies. Sweden’s central bank this week dumped government bonds from Alberta, Canada, and Queensland, Australia, because of their high emissions. Then there’s the Bank of England, which plans to incorporate global warming and government climate policies in its bank stress tests. This means that banks will be punished if they hold assets in fossil fuels. Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau in September warned that global warming could cause a “stagflationary shock.” Liberals in the U.S. are essentially urging the Fed to add reducing CO2 emissions to its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. Twenty Democratic Senators, including Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar, wrote in January to Mr. Powell that “U.S. regulators must join their international peers in ensuring the financial system is resilient to climate-related risks.” Last week the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank held a climate research conference where economists warned that rising emissions could destabilize the financial system. Studying climate risk is “essential to achieving our mission,” San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly declared. The Fed didn’t anticipate the financial panic of 2008 and is more often wrong than right in its economic forecasts, but somehow it will be able to predict the impact of variable climate on the financial system? The real danger is that, by favoring green investments, central bankers will misallocate capital or distort valuations. We saw what happened when central banks gave a low risk weight to mortgage securities, which encouraged banks to pile into housing. Mr. Powell is right to push back against this climate attack on the Fed’s independence. ',\n",
       " ' It is a vision laid out by many supporters of Britain’s departure from the European Union: a dynamic economy freed of the shackles imposed by the dead hand of regulation from Brussels. It raises a huge question, however: How much of this outward-looking, free-market future would be politically achievable? The issues boil down to these. Would the U.K. be able to improve on the trade agreements that it currently has within the EU and that the bloc has with non-EU countries? And would it be possible, post “Brexit,” to push a bonfire of employment, climate and other regulations through Parliament in London? On both scores, there is room for hesitation.  There is no doubt that the EU is responsible for large swaths of regulation that affect the British economy. The EU “has increasingly become a force for heavy-handed and petty regulation rather than for free-market liberalism,” Mark Littlewood of the free-market Institute of Economic Affairs said last month. Surveys of U.K. businesses regularly show that overregulation is a strong concern, and that the EU has contributed significantly to it. There is a limit, however, to how far Europe has forced the U.K.’s unwilling hand. Data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show the U.K. has the second-freest product markets among 54 countries it sampled, after the Netherlands, another EU country. As for labor-market flexibility, it is the most flexible economy in Europe, slightly less flexible than Canada but more so than Australia. The think tank Open Europe has estimated that the 100 most expensive EU-derived regulations cost the U.K. economy about £33.3 billion ($47 billion) a year. (The benefits, calculated from government data, exceed this.) Paring these regulations back could save £12.8 billion a year, or 0.7% of gross domestic product. Some £5.8 billion of this saving could come from softening environment and climate-change laws, for example, by scrapping targets for renewable energy and pulling out of the EU emissions-trading system. Another promising contender: employment, social and health-and-safety laws. Here, it estimated £5.6 billion could feasibly be saved by, among other things, scrapping EU laws involving temporary-employment agencies and reining in the directive on working time. But as Open Europe pointed out in its report this week, these steps “will involve politically challenging decisions and may also mean shifting the trend of domestic policy.” Doing it will also mean limiting the level of economic integration with the EU, because the closer a country is tied to the bloc, the more of its rules it has to accept. On climate change, deregulation would involve a change of direction for the U.K., which “has gone further than EU standards and continues to do so,” the report said. Pushing through those decisions would be even more challenging because the main opposition Labour Party has abandoned the pro-business stance it took in government from 1997 to 2010. And the Scottish Nationalists, now an important force in London, also favor strong state intervention. Jeremy Corbyn, Labour’s new leader, laid out Thursday what he called “the strong socialist case” for staying in the EU. A key part of the argument was that the EU provided a bulwark against right-wing efforts to undermine workers’ rights, to go easy on tax dodgers and to ignore the perils of climate change. “The free-market enthusiasts in the Leave campaign would put all those protections at risk,” he said. On trade, Open Europe’s analysis questions too the openness of the economy, suggesting that immediately after exit, U.K.’s trade in goods and services will be less free than it is now. That is in part because the U.K. would likely lose its membership of the EU single market. The price of accepting insider status in the single market from outside the bloc would likely be too high: accepting EU regulation without getting a vote on it, and acceding to free movement of EU workers—the issue over which many people will vote to leave. The other reason is that negotiating free-trade deals with non-EU countries would take many years. These agreements might eventually be broader in scope than those the EU currently has. But the more extensive a free-trade agreement, the longer the time needed usually to negotiate them. And as current worries about the impact on British industry of cheap Chinese steel show, free trade isn’t always popular. One further attribute of an open, outward-facing economy is openness to immigration, which economists say helps maintain a flexible supply of labor. Outside the EU, the U.K. should be able to implement selective immigration policies that would be less open to EU workers and more open to the rest of the world. That could be economically beneficial and more politically acceptable than now, Open Europe concluded. But net immigration is likely to remain high whether the U.K. stays in or leaves the EU. The U.K.’s economic path after leaving the EU would be critically shaped by the political decisions that follow. There hasn’t yet been a popular debate about that, and there are no guarantees about the direction that will be taken. Write to Stephen Fidler at stephen.fidler@wsj.com ',\n",
       " 'It was the steak dinners, Ethan Brown says, that changed his life. He had embarked on a career in the clean-energy industry, a path befitting an environmentalist out to save the world. But the incongruity he perceived among his colleagues, who would lament environmental problems while eating beef, pushed Brown — a vegetarian since age 18 — in a different direction.\\n“We would go to conferences and sit there wringing our hands over all these [energy] issues, and then we’d go to dinner and people would order huge steaks,” Brown told Popular Science in 2013.\\nBrown left the energy industry and founded a start-up called Beyond Meat in 2009, building on the work of University of Missouri food scientist Fu-hung Hsieh, a pioneer in “high moisture extrusion of fibrous meat analog” — making fake meat taste more like flesh, in other words. Beyond Meat achieved early hype with its Beyond Chicken strips, designed to obliterate memories of limp tofu dogs or crumbly veggie burgers. Observing the strips shred into ligament-like strands at Beyond Meat’s factory in Columbus, Mo., Food Network star and author Alton Brown remarked to Wired in 2013, “It’s more like meat than anything I’ve ever seen that wasn’t meat.”\\nAdvertisement\\nBeyond Meat bills its latest creation, the Beyond Burger, as the most meat-like non-meat feat yet. It has been on sale for a single day — on Monday, in a Whole Foods in Boulder, Colo. — and is already being compared to, as the New York Times puts it, the “holy grail” of ersatz animal protein: A plant burger upon which a human carnivore would happily snack.\\nA Beyond Burger patty contains 20 grams of vegetable protein, mostly from peas, while lacking gluten and soy. If you prick a Beyond Burger, does it bleed? Yes, the company says, though its blood is pulverized beet juice. Beyond Meat took a completionist approach to its hamburger doppelganger: The Beyond Burger had to look, smell and feel like meat.\\nOnce humans started cultivating wild plants, fruits and vegetables got a lot more colorful. (Video: Daron Taylor, Dani Johnson, Osman Malik/The Washington Post)\\nThis was no easy task. Animal meat is not a uniform product, but plants, on the other hand, don’t come marbled with fat or sprout gristly connective tissues. (Even lab-grown beef patties, a different beast from Beyond Meat’s burger, have struggled to mirror the heterogeneous chow you’d buy from a butcher.) It was up to researchers like Stanford University structural biologist Joseph D. Puglisi, a scientific adviser to Beyond Meat, to devise a way to deposit plant fat in layers. “We were able to get fat distributed throughout a patty — but in meat, fat is distributed in sheets,” he told the New York Times.\\nAdvertisement\\nBeyond Meat’s ability to replicate meaty layers out of plant matter is among the company’s greatest trade secrets — what puts it in a different category, perhaps, than the long line of faux meats that have come before. Biz Stone, one of Twitter’s founders and a Beyond Meat backer, described the company’s fake chicken to Fast Company as having a meaty mouth feel. “It feels fatty and muscly and like it’s not good for you when you’re chewing it,” Stone said in 2012. “For a long-time vegan, it’s a little bit freaky.”\\nSergey Brin isn’t the only tech entrepreneur investing in artificial meat\\n(How closely a bite of the fake chicken, au naturel, mimics the real bird is a matter of debate; when tucked in a wrap, however, the game seems to change. New York Times’s Mark Bittman wrote in 2012 that Beyond Meat’s Brown fooled the food columnist “badly” in a taste test.)\\nThis may seem like a lot of noise over mashed peas, unless you care about what Brown described in an interview with Business Insider last year as his four horsemen: animal welfare, climate change, human health and natural resources. Livestock — thanks to factors like cow burps — are a significant contributor of the greenhouse gas methane. Because crops take up about half as much space as livestock, a recent study in the journal Nature Communications concluded that a global vegetarian diet would be the most feasible way to feed 2050’s estimated population without expanding today’s farmland.\\nAdvertisement\\nLivestock farms have direct detrimental impacts on human health as well. Due to widespread antibiotic use in livestock, the Centers for Disease Control estimates that 20 percent of antibiotic resistant infections originate from food. The demand for meat produced cheaply and quickly, too, may lead to poor working conditions; as one worker in the poultry industry told Oxfam America, the individual allegedly had to wear diapers on the job because bathroom breaks were verboten.\\nThe not-so-humane way ‘humanely raised’ chickens are being raised\\nBrown says his goal with the Beyond Burger is nothing less than redefining meat to include plant protein, urging Whole Foods to sell the vegetable patties alongside their flesh-and-blood equivalents. On Facebook, some vegetarians expressed discomfort about the Beyond Burgers’s close proximity to what one commenter described as “little cellophaned packets of death.” The company defended its power play for the meat aisle, as it wrote on Facebook, as “the opening shot in our bid to transform the meat case into the protein case.”\\nIf such a complete transformation is the goal, the company will need to send in reinforcement burgers — the first batch sold out in an hour, according to Beyond Meat’s Twitter feed.\\nThe burgers cost $5.99 for a pack of two patties. Beyond Meat says it plans to expand to Denver and Washington, D.C., soon, and beyond Colorado over the summer.\\n']"

      "Want to know how your actions can help make a difference for our planet? Sign up for the Climate Coach newsletter, in your inbox every Tuesday and Thursday.\n",
      "But the undercurrent of Tuesday’s public announcement, which included former vice president and climate activist Al Gore taking a turn at the podium, was anything but subtle: New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and his counterparts from around the country vowed to “collectively, collaboratively and aggressively” investigate whether fossil fuel companies such as ExxonMobil have misled shareholders and the public about what they knew — and when — about the risks of climate change.\n",
      "“We have heard the scientists; we know what’s happening to the planet,” Schneiderman said. “But there is confusion, sowed by those with an interest in profiting from the confusion and creating misperceptions in the eyes of the American public.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Schneiderman began investigating ExxonMobil last fall, subpoenaing documents from the company in the wake of reporting by the Los Angeles Times and the online publication Inside Climate News that showed Exxon’s in-house researchers were concerned about climate change from fossil-fuel emissions decades ago, and yet for a long time, the company publicly raised doubts about the science. \\\n",
      "Schneiderman has leeway to undertake such an investigation under both consumer protection laws and New York’s Martin Act, a securities law that protects investors.\n",
      "New York is investigating Exxon Mobil for allegedly misleading the public about climate change\n",
      "The California attorney general’s office has since initiated its own investigation, and on Tuesday, at least two more attorneys general — Maura Healey of Massachusetts and Claude Walker of the Virgin Islands — said they also had opened inquiries into Exxon’s actions.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Suzanne McCarron, ExxonMobil’s vice president of public and government affairs, said in a statement that the accusations against the company are “politically motivated and based on discredited reporting funded by activist organizations” and that ExxonMobil is “actively assessing all legal options.”\n",
      "She added that the allegations are “preposterous” and “based on the false premise that ExxonMobil reached definitive conclusions about anthropogenic climate change before the world’s experts and before the science itself had matured, and then withheld it from the broader scientific community.” McCarron said the company openly shared findings in peer-reviewed publications and actively contributed to the work of the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n",
      "“The allegations repeated today are an attempt to limit free speech and are the antithesis of scientific inquiry,” McCarron said. “Left unchallenged, they could stifle the search for solutions to the real risks from climate change.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "While ExxonMobil might have been the company publicly in the crosshairs this week, the carefully coordinated announcement in New York could signal the beginning stages of a broader reckoning for big energy companies facing questions about what they knew about climate change, and when.\n",
      "At least Gore seemed to think so.\n",
      "Years from now, the former vice president insisted, the convening of this group of state law enforcement officials will be viewed as “a real turning point” in the efforts to hold to account companies that have deceived investors and the public about climate change. He went as far as to liken the effort to similar action taken decades ago against the tobacco industry, which despite growing health warnings long denied the harmful nature of its products, until state attorneys general led the way in forcing the industry to acknowledge it had known of the potential dangers all along.\n",
